There are two options for build systems that you can use with YugabyteDB, [`ninja`](https://ninja-build.org/) and [`make`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).
Note that the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) meta build system is used in both cases, and it generates build files consumed by the underlying Ninja and Make build systems.

* `ninja` is faster than `make`, especially for rebuilding mostly-built projects, but CLion has limited support for `ninja` (for example, it doesn't allow you to [rebuild individual files](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-17622)).
* `make` is well-supported by CLion, but slower, particularly for rebuilding mostly-built projects, compared to `ninja`.

### Configure a CLion project for YugabyteDB

#### Opening the directory

Click **File > Open…** to open the project root directory.

#### Configuring CMake preferences

##### Setting CMake preferences when using Ninja

If you want to build with Ninja, use `build/debug-clang-dynamic-ninja` as a "Generation path" and add `-G Ninja` into "CMake options":

##### Setting CMake preferences when using Make

Select `build/debug-clang-dynamic` as the **Generation path** in **Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment/CMake”**, and do not specify anything for **CMake options**.

#### Reloading the project

Use **"File / Reload CMake Project"**. CLion will start updating symbols, which also can take a while.

#### Doing the build from CLion

Run from the command line inside project root outside CLion (omit `YB_USE_NINJA=0` if you want to use Ninja):

```sh
YB_USE_NINJA=0 ./yb_build.sh
```

Subsequent builds can be launched also from CLion.
