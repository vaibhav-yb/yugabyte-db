## Included markdown

This content is included from a separate file (called, in this case, `include-markdown.md`) using an `includeMarkdown` shortcode.

Headings in included markdown files _do_ appear in the right navigation.

### Another heading in the included markdown

Use includeMarkdown to add repetitive text to multiple pages.
