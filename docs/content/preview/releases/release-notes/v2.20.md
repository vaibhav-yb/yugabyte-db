{{< warning title="Use database version 2.20.1.3 or later" >}}
YugabyteDB releases in the v2.20 series prior to v2.20.1.3 contain an issue where an index update can be wrongly applied leading to index corruption for the following rare cases:

- Update to a table with non-unique indexes and self-referential triggers where both the index updates, and the trigger application affect the same rows.
- Multi-row update to a table with a non-unique partial index.

For more information, see [#20648](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20648).

If you're using a previous v2.20 database version, it is recommended that you upgrade to YugabyteDB 2.20.1.3 or later.

### Improvements

#### YSQL

* Adjusts ysql_dump when run with `--include-yb-metadata` argument, to circumvent unnecessary automatic index backfilling. This avoids unnecessary RPC calls. {{<issue 19457>}}
* Imports the `pgcrypto: Check for error return of px_cipher_decrypt` upstream PostgreSQL patch; OpenSSL 3.0+ prerequisite. {{<issue 19732>}}
* Imports the upstream PG commit `Disable OpenSSL EVP digest padding in pgcrypto`; OpenSSL 3.0+ prerequisite. {{<issue 19733>}}
* Imports an upstream PostgreSQL commit that adds an alternative output when OpenSSL 3 doesn't load legacy modules; OpenSSL 3.0+ prerequisite. {{<issue 19734>}}
* Removes the need for a table scan when adding a new column with a `NOT NULL` constraint and a non-volatile `DEFAULT` value, enhancing ADD COLUMN operations. {{<issue 19355>}}
* Mitigates CVE-2023-39417 by importing a security-focused upstream Postgres commit from REL_11_STABLE for YSQL users. {{<issue 14419>}}
* Fixes CVE-2020-1720 by importing upstream Postgres commit from REL_11_STABLE, enabling support for `ALTER <object>DEPENDS ON EXTENSION` in future for objects like function, procedure, routine, trigger, materialized view, and index. {{<issue 14419>}}
* Modifies the planner to allow ordered index scans with IN conditions on lower columns; this takes advantage of the YB LSM indexes, which maintain index order. {{<issue 19576>}}
* Increase the oom_score_adj (Out of Memory score adjustment) of the YSQL webserver to 900, the same as PG backends, prioritizing its termination when it significantly consumes memory. {{<issue 20028>}}
* Blocks the use of advisory locks in YSQL, as they are currently unsupported. {{<issue 18954>}}
* Introduces `yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error` as a temporary solution, avoiding disruption while users transition from the use of advisory locks. {{<issue 19974>}}

#### DocDB

* Enable checks for trailing zeros in SST data files to help identify potential corruption. {{<issue 19691>}}
* Includes version information in the error message when the yb process crashes due to AutoFlags being enabled on an unsupported older version, enhancing the ease of identifying the issue. {{<issue 16181>}}
* Prints long trace logs with a continuation marker when a trace is split into multiple LOG(INFO) outputs. This is for log readability. {{<issue 19532>}},{{<issue 19808>}}
* Upgrades OpenSSL to version 3.0.8, disabling Linuxbrew builds and updating glog for stack unwinding based on the backtrace function. {{<issue 19736>}}
* Expands debug information to help investigate SELECT command errors that imply faults in read path processing or provisional record writing. {{<issue 19876>}}
* Adds support for `rocksdb_max_sst_write_retries` flag: maximum allowed number of attempts to write SST file in case of detected corruption after write (by default 0 which means no retries). Implemented for both flushes and compactions. {{<issue 19730>}}
* Balances load during tablet creation across all drives, preventing bottlenecks and underutilized drives during remote-bootstrapping; uses total number of tablets assigned for tie-breaking. {{<issue 19846>}}
* Adds tserver page to display all ongoing Remote Bootstrap sessions, and shows the source of bootstrap sessions in the `Last Status` field, for improved visibility. {{<issue 19568>}}
* Enhances error reporting from XClusterPollers by storing just the error code instead of detailed status, making it safer against master and Tserver restarts and reducing memory usage. {{<issue 19455>}}
* Incorporates a JoinStringsLimitCount utility for displaying only the first 20 elements in a large array, saving memory and space while logging or reporting tablet IDs. {{<issue 19527>}}
* Adds a sanity check to prevent restoration of the initial sys catalog snapshot when the `master_join_existing_universe` flag is set. {{<issue 19357>}}
* Parallelizes RPCs in `DoGetLockStatus` to fetch locks swiftly, enhancing the database's response time while retrieving old transactions. {{<issue 18034>}}
* Simplifies xCluster replication failure debugging via a new `get_auto_flags_config` yb-admin command, returning the current AutoFlags config. {{<issue 20046>}}
* Enables automatic recovery of index tables affected by {{<issue 19544>}}, improving performance and disk size management by removing excess tombstones in the SST files. {{<issue 19731>}}
* Introduces verbose logging for global and per table state transitions in the load balancer to facilitate easier debugging. {{<issue 20289>}}

#### CDC

* Allows the catalog manager to eliminate erroneous entries from the `cdc_state` table for newly split tablets; prevents race conditions by reversing the order of operations during the `CleanUpCDCStreamsMetadata` process. {{<issue 19746>}}

#### yugabyted

* Resolves `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` as the IP for master, tserver and yugabyted-UI when `0.0.0.0` is specified as the `advertise_address` in `yugabyted start` command. {{<issue 18580>}}
* Ensures the yugabyted UI can fetch and display `Alert` messages from different nodes by adjusting the `/alerts` endpoint in the API server to include a `node_address` parameter. {{<issue 19972>}}
* Eliminates the deprecated `use_initial_sys_catalog_snapshot` gflag in yugabyted, thus reducing log warning messages. {{<issue 20056>}}

#### Other

* Better indentation of multi-line remote trace entry output, for readability. {{<issue 19758>}}
* Implements a preventative safeguard in tserver operations by adding a check that a tablet has explicitly been deleted before issuing a `DeleteTablet` command, minimizing data loss risks and enhancing reliability. This feature, enabled with `master_enable_deletion_check_for_orphaned_tablets=true`, is upgrade and downgrade safe. {{<issue 18332>}}

### Bug fixes

#### YSQL

* Allows the postprocess script in `pg_regress` to run on alternative expected files alongside `default_expectfile` and `platform_expectfile`, fixing unintended mismatches. {{<issue 19737>}}
* Prevents stuck PostgreSQL processes and ensures successful acquisition of locks in the future. This enhancement particularly aids in preventing deadlocks when creating replication slots with duplicate names. {{<issue 19509>}}
* Ensures OID uniqueness within a database in YB environment by introducing a new per-database OID allocator, avoiding risk of collisions across multiple nodes or tenants. This change is safe for upgrades and rollbacks, enabled by a new gflag `ysql_enable_pg_per_database_oid_allocator`. {{<issue 16130>}}
* Prevents postmaster crashes during connection termination cleanup by using the killed process's `ProcStruct` to wait on a lock. {{<issue 18000>}}
* Fixes the distinct query iteration to distinguish between deleted and live keys; this prevents missing live rows during distinct queries on tables with dead tuples. {{<issue 19911>}}
* Fixes bug when type-checking bound tuple IN conditions involving binary columns like UUID. {{<issue 19753>}}
* Ensures PK modification does not disable Row-Level Security (RLS). {{<issue 19815>}}
* Tracks spinlock acquisition during process initialisation, and reduce the time to detect spinlock deadlock. {{<issue 18272>}},{{<issue 18265>}}
* Reverts to PG restart in rare event of process termination during initiation or cleanup; this avoids needing to determine what subset of shared memory items to clean. {{<issue 19945>}}
* Prevents unexpected crashes during plan creation when joining two varchar columns. Handles the derivation of `element_typeid` in Batched Nested Loop (BNL) queries; casts both sides to text to ensure valid equality expression. {{<issue 20003>}}
* Reduces Proc struct consumption by enabling cleanup for killed background workers, preventing webserver start-up failure after 8 attempts. {{<issue 20154>}}
* Frees up large volumes of unused memory from the webserver after processing queries, enhancing periodic workloads by reallocating held memory to the OS more effectively. {{<issue 20040>}}
* Introduces two new boolean flags for YSQL webserver debugging and failure identification.The first will log every endpoint access and its list of arguments before running the path handler. The second will print basic tcmalloc stats after the path handler and garbage collection have run. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Rectifies an issue causing segmentation faults when the postmaster acquires already owned LWLock, enhancing stability during process cleanup. Uses KilledProcToCleanup instead of MyProc if acquiring locks under the postmaster. {{<issue 20166>}}
* Improves insight into webserver memory usage `:13000/memz` and `:13000/webserver-heap-prof`, which print tcmalloc stats and display currents or peak allocations respectively. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Restarts postmaster in critical sections.This applies to backend PG code; defines and improves handling of errors in these sections. {{<issue 20255>}}
* Caps the number of attempts to read inconsistent backend entries to 1000 for safer operation and better visibility, limiting potential infinite loops in `/rpcz` calls and logging every hundredth attempt. {{<issue 20274>}}
* Resolves segmentation faults in the webserver SIGHUP handler during cleanup. {{<issue 20309>}}
* Allows the finalize_plan function to now apply finalize_primnode on PushdownExprs, ensuring Parameter nodes in subplans transfer values accurately, especially in Parallel Queries. {{<issue 19694>}}

#### DocDB

* Enables Masters to decrypt universe key registry correctly when Master turns into a leader following Remote Bootstrap. correctly when it turns into a leader. {{<issue 19513>}}
* Fixes metric retryable requests mem-tracker metric so it's aggregated at table-level {{<issue 19301>}}
* Ensure data consistency by checking if there is pending apply record, preventing the removal of large transactions that are still applying intents during bootstrap. {{<issue 19359>}}
* Prevents a write to freed memory; `RefinedStream::Connected` returns status instead of calling `context_->Destroy(status)`. {{<issue 19727>}}
* Allows serving remote bootstrap from a follower peer, i.e. initial remote log anchor request is at the follower's last logged operation id index, reducing probability of fallback to bootstrap from the leader; this could increase system efficiency under high load. {{<issue 19536>}}
* Corrects Master's tablet_overhead memory tracker to correctly display consumption, ensuring accurate reflection of data in Memory Breakdown UI page, and aligns MemTracker metric names between TServer and Master. {{<issue 19904>}}
* Resolves intermittent index creation failure for empty YCQL tables by validating the `is_running` state instead of checking the index state directly; prevents inaccurate values in old indexes and ensuring `retain_delete_markers` are correctly set to false. {{<issue 19933>}}
* Addresses a deadlock issue during tablet shutdown with wait-queues enabled by modifying the Wait-Queue shutdown path to set shutdown flags during `StartShutdown` and process callbacks during `CompleteShutdown`. {{<issue 19867>}}
* Reduces race conditions in `MasterChangeConfigTest.TestBlockRemoveServerWhenConfigHasTransitioningServer` by letting asynchronous threads operate on `ExternalMaster*` copies, not `current_masters`. {{<issue 19927>}}
* Allows only a single heap profile to run at a time, restricting concurrent profile runs to avoid misinterpretation of sampling frequency reset values. {{<issue 19841>}}
* Eliminates misleading `Transaction Metadata Missing` errors during a deadlock by replacing them with more accurate deadlock-specific messages. {{<issue 20016>}}
* Fixes behavior of Tcmalloc sampling; deprecates the `enable_process_lifetime_heap_sampling` flag in favor of directly setting `profiler_sample_freq_bytes` for controlling tcmalloc sampling, enhancing control over sampling process. {{<issue 20236>}}

#### CDC

* Corrects a deadlock during the deletion of a database with CDC streams by ensuring namespace-level CDC stream does not add the same stream per table more than once. {{<issue 19879>}}

#### yugabyted

* Adds a check for a join flag to avoid error when starting two different local RF-1 YugabyteDB instances on mac {{<issue 20018>}}

#### Other

* Rectifies the CentOS GCC11 and background worker asan build issues by utilizing stack allocation and eliminating the unsupported std::string::erase with const iterators. {{<issue 20147>}},{{<issue 20087>}}
* Fixes segmentation fault in stats collector after Postmaster reset by cleaning up after terminated backends and properly resetting shared memory and structures, resulting in improved stability and reliability of the system. {{<issue 19672>}}
* Allows custom port configurations in multi-region/zone YugabyteDB clusters to prevent connectivity problems during cluster setup. {{<issue 15334>}}

### Highlights

* Support for OIDC token-based authentication via Azure AD. This allows YSQL database users to sign in to YugabyteDB universes using their JSON Web Token (JWT) as their password.
* Support for Transactional CDC.
* Wait-on conflict concurrency control with pg_locks. This feature is especially important to users that have workloads with many multi-tablet statements, which may have multiple sessions contending for the same locks concurrently. Wait-on conflict concurrency control helps avoid a deadlock scenario as well as ensure fairness so a session is not starved by new sessions. {{<badge/ea>}}
* Catalog metadata caching to improve YSQL connection scalability and performance with faster warm up times. {{<badge/ea>}}
* Support for ALTER COLUMN TYPE with on-disk changes is now {{<badge/ga>}} for production deployments. This feature expands ALTER TABLE capabilities with a broader range of data type modifications, including changes to the type itself, not just size increments.
