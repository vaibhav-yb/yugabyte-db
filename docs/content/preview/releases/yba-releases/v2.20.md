## v2.20.0.0 - November 13, 2023 {#2.20.0.0}

**Build:** `2.20.0.0-b76`

**Third-party licenses:** [YugabyteDB](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.20.0.0/yugabytedb-2.20.0.0-b76-third-party-licenses.html), [YugabyteDB Anywhere](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.20.0.0/yugabytedb-anywhere-2.20.0.0-b76-third-party-licenses.html)

### Docker

```sh
docker pull yugabytedb/yugabyte:2.20.0.0-b76
```

### Highlights

* Support for OIDC token-based authentication via Azure AD. This allows YSQL database users to sign in to YugabyteDB Anywhere universes using their JSON Web Token (JWT) as their password. When configured in YugabytedDB Anywhere, users can obtain their token from their YugabyteDB Anywhere user profile, or copy it from the YugabyteDB Anywhere landing page.

* Ability to browse the full history of restores for universes. After performing a restore, navigate to the **Restore History** tab to verify restore details and view all previous restores.

* Support for backing up and restoring tablespaces. You can now restore tablespaces to a universe with a matching topology; that is, a universe that have the same zones and regions as the backed up universe.

* Online point-in-time-recovery (PITR), which allows you to perform PITR without the need to stop any workloads.

* Enhanced metrics display. Click and drag to select a time range in any chart to zoom in to display granular data points.

* Quicker rolling restarts due to enhancements that accelerate the time it takes to perform local bootstrapping of tablets.

* Improved safety checks for rolling upgrades. Before a node is upgraded, YugabyteDB Anywhere checks for under-replicated tablets to make sure your universe is in a healthy state before proceeding with the upgrade.

* Improvements to node disk usage alerts to support alerting on non-data partitions.
