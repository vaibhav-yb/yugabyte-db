YugabyteDB Managed performs full cluster (all namespaces) level backups, and the backups are stored in the same region as your cluster. 100GB/month of basic backup storage is provided for every vCPU; more than that and overage charges apply. Refer to [Cluster costs](../../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-costs/).

By default, clusters are backed up automatically every 24 hours, and these automatic backups are retained for 8 days. The first automatic backup is triggered after 24 hours of creating a table, and is scheduled every 24 hours thereafter.

Back up and restore clusters, configure the automatic backup policy, and review previous backups and restores using the cluster **Backups** tab.

To change the backup schedule, [create your own schedule](#schedule-backups). To enable or disable scheduled backups, click the **Scheduled backup** option.

You can also perform backups [on demand](#on-demand-backups) and manually [restore backups](#restore-a-backup).

To delete a backup, click the **Delete** icon.

To review previous backups, click **Backup**. To review previous restores, click **Restore**.

## Limitations

If [some cluster operations](../#locking-operations) are already running during a scheduled backup window, the backup may be prevented from running.

Backups that don't run are postponed until the next scheduled backup. You can also perform a manual backup after the blocking operation completes.

You can't restore a backup to a cluster with an version of YugabyteDB that is earlier than that of the backup. If you need to restore to an earlier version, contact {{% support-cloud %}}.

Backups are not supported for Sandbox clusters.

## Recommendations

- Don't perform cluster operations at the same time as your scheduled backup.
- Configure your [maintenance window](../cloud-maintenance/) and [backup schedule](#schedule-backups) so that they do not conflict.
- Performing a backup or restore incurs a load on the cluster. Perform backup operations when the cluster isn't experiencing heavy traffic. Backing up during times of heavy traffic can temporarily degrade application performance and increase the length of time of the backup.
- Avoid running a backup during or before a scheduled maintenance.

## On demand backups

Typically, you perform on-demand backups before making critical planned changes to the database.

To back up a cluster:

1. On the **Backups** tab, click **Backup Now** to display the **Create Backup** dialog.
1. Set the retention period for the backup.
1. Optionally, enter a description of the backup.
1. Click **Backup Now**.

The backup, along with its status, is added to the Backups list.

## Schedule backups

Use scheduled backups to override the default 24 hour/8-day retention policy with your own schedule.

Any changes to the retention policy are applied to new backups only.

To schedule backups for a cluster:

1. On the **Backups** tab, click **Policy Settings** to display the **Backup Policy Settings** dialog.
1. Set the retention period for the backup. The maximum retention is 31 days.
1. Choose **Simple** to set the frequency for the backups. Choose **Custom** to select the days of the week to run backups, along with the start time.
1. Click **Update Policy**.

## Restore a backup

Before performing a restore, ensure the following:

- the target cluster is sized appropriately; refer to [Scale and configure clusters](../configure-clusters/)
- if the target cluster has the same namespaces as the source cluster, those namespaces don't have any tables

To review previous restores, click **Restore**.

To restore a backup of a cluster:

1. On the **Backups** tab, select a backup in the list and click the **Restore** icon to display the **Restore Backup** dialog.
1. Select the target cluster.
1. Click **Restore**.
