You can export cluster metrics to third-party tools for analysis and customization. Exporting metrics for a cluster is a two-stage process:

1. Create an export configuration. An export configuration defines the settings and login information for the tool that you want to export your metrics to.
1. Assign a configuration to the cluster. Once created, you can assign an export configuration to one or more clusters. While the connection is active, metrics are automatically streamed to the tool.

Currently, YugabyteDB Managed supports export to [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/?plcmt=learn-nav), and [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com). Metrics export is not available for Sandbox clusters.

Exporting metrics counts against your data transfer allowance, and may incur additional costs for network transfer, especially for cross-region and internet-based transfers, if usage exceeds your cluster allowance. Refer to [Data transfer costs](../../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-costs/#data-transfer-costs).

## Prerequisites

### Datadog

The YugabyteDB Managed [Datadog integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/yugabytedb_managed/) requires the following:

- Datadog account
- Datadog [API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/)

### Grafana

- Grafana account and stack. For best performance and lower data transfer costs, deploy your stack in the region closest to your cluster. For a list of supported regions, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/otlp/send-data-otlp/#send-data-using-opentelemetry-protocol-otlp).
- Access policy token. You need to create an Access policy with metrics:write scope, and then add a token. For more information, see [Grafana Cloud Access Policies](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/account-management/authentication-and-permissions/access-policies/authorize-services/) in the Grafana documentation.

### Sumo Logic

- Create an [access ID and access key](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/) on the **Preferences** page under your profile name.
- [Installation token](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens/). These are available under **Administration > Security > Installation Tokens**.
- To use the dashboard template, [install the YugabyteDB app](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/) (coming soon) in your Sumo Logic account.

## Export configuration

Create export configurations and assign them to clusters on the **Integrations > Metrics** tab.

![Integrations Metrics tab](/images/yb-cloud/managed-metrics-export.png)

The tab lists any export configurations that you have created, along with the clusters in your account, and the status of any metrics export that has been assigned.

You can also access metrics export on the cluster **Settings** tab under **Export Metrics**.

### Manage export configurations

You can add, edit, and delete export configurations. You can't delete a configuration that is assigned to a cluster.

To edit a configuration, click the **...** button on the configuration and choose **Edit**.

To delete a configuration, click the **...** button on the configuration and choose **Delete**.

### Manage cluster metrics export

You can assign a metrics configuration to one or more clusters to begin exporting metrics from those clusters. You can also pause and resume metrics export for a cluster.

To assign an export configuration to a cluster, in the **Export Metrics by Cluster** table, in the **Export Configurations** column, choose a configuration for the cluster.

To remove an export configuration from a cluster, in the **Export Metrics by Cluster** table, set the **Export Configurations** column to **None**.

To pause or resume metrics export from a cluster, in the **Export Metrics by Cluster** table, click the **...** button for the cluster, and choose **Pause** or **Resume**.
