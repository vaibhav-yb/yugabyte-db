    Otherwise, enter your contact details and click **Request Free Trial**. The Yugabyte team will contact you within two business days. In the meantime:

    - [create a Sandbox cluster](../cloud-basics/create-clusters/create-clusters-free/) and run the tutorial to learn about distributed SQL
    - [run a lab](../managed-labs/) to learn how to design global applications

After the free trial begins, you can use your credits to create dedicated clusters in a [variety of topologies](../cloud-basics/create-clusters-topology/), including:

- Single region multi zone
- Replicated across regions
- Partition by region
- Read replicas

Create a [billing profile](../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-profile/) and add a payment method any time. You won't be charged until your credits are used.

Only one free trial can be applied to an account.
