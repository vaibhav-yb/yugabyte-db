Use the **Slow Queries** dashboard to analyze statistics of past queries on your YugabyteDB universes. You can use this data for the following:

- Visually identifying slower running database operations.
- Evaluating query execution times over time.
- Discovering potential queries for memory optimization.

All user roles — `Super Admin`, `Admin`, and `Read-only` — are granted permissions to use the **Slow Queries** dashboard.

Note that slow queries are not available for YCQL.

The following table describes the **Slow Queries** column values.

| Column          | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Query           | The query command.<br>Example: <br>`select * from my_keyspace.my_table` |
| Database        | The YSQL database used by the query.                         |
| User            | The name of role used to access YSQL database.               |
| Count           | The total number of times this type of query has executed.   |
| Total time      | The total duration (in milliseconds) this query has taken.   |
| Rows            | The total number of database table rows returned across all iterations of this query |
| Avg Exec Time   | Average or mean execution time (in milliseconds) for this query. |
| Min Exec Time   | Minimum execution time (in milliseconds) for this query.     |
| Max Exec Time   | Maximum execution time (in milliseconds) for this query.     |
| Std Dev Time    | Standard deviation of execution times for this query.        |
| Temp Tables RAM | Memory used by temporary tables generated from query.        |

You can use the **Slow Queries** dashboard as follows:

- Navigate to the **Universes**, select your universe, then select **Queries > Slow Queries**, as per the following illustration:<br>

  ![Initial layout](/images/yp/alerts-monitoring/slow-queries/initial-table-view.png)<br>

  Note that you might need to enable query monitoring for your universe. If enabled, using **Column Display** allows you to dynamically display specific fields, as per the following illustration:<br>

  ![Changing column selection](/images/yp/alerts-monitoring/slow-queries/selecting-columns.png)<br>

- Click the filter field to be able to use a query language for filtering data based on certain fields, as per the following illustration:<br>

  ![Search dropdown options](/images/yp/alerts-monitoring/slow-queries/search-dropdown-options.png)<br>

  Use filtering for comparisons on numbers columns (`Avg Time`) using `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` to search for values that are greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to another value (`Avg Time: < 30`). You can also use the range syntax `n..m` to search for values within a range, where the first number `n` is the lowest value and the second number `m` is the highest value. The range syntax supports tokens like the following: `n..*` which is equivalent to `>= n`. Or `*..n` which is the same as `<= n`.

- Select a row to open a sidebar with a full view of the query statement, along with all the column data, as per the following illustration:<br>

  You can find additional prefiltered navigation links from different pages to the **Slow Queries** page. For example, from the **Overview** page to the **Queries** page, when you click the link to Top SQL Statements, as per the folloiwng illustration:<br>

  ![Overview page showing slow queries](/images/yp/alerts-monitoring/slow-queries/overview-showing-link.png)<br>

  Or, for example, the **Nodes** page's each node **Actions** contains a link to the **Slow Queries** page.
