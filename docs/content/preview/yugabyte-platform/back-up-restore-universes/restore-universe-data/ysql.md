## Basic restore procedure

You can restore YugabyteDB universe YSQL data from a backup as follows:

1. Open your universe and select **Backups**.

2. If you want to restore a backup from a specific keyspace, click on the backup and use its **Backup Details** page to perform the restore procedure.

3. If you want to restore a full backup, use the **Backups** page to select the backup and click its **... > Restore Entire Backup**, as per the following illustration:<br><br>

    ![Restore backup](/images/yp/restore-entire-backup.png)<br><br><br>

4. Complete the fields of the **Restore Backup** dialog shown in the following illustration:

    <br/><br/>
    ![Restore backup - YSQL](/images/yp/restore-universe-data-ysql.png)<br><br><br>

    - Select the name of the universe to which you want to restore the backup.

    - Optionally and depending on your cloud provider, if the backup was from a universe that has [encryption at rest enabled](../../../security/enable-encryption-at-rest), then select the KMS configuration to use.

    - Refrain from selecting  **Rename databases in this backup before restoring**.

    - Optionally, specify the number of parallel threads that are allowed to run. This can be any number between 1 and 100.

    - Click **Restore**.<br>

      The restore begins immediately. When finished, a completed **Restore Backup** task appears under **Tasks > Task History**.

5. To confirm that the restore succeeded, select **Tables** to compare the original table with the table to which you restored.

## Advanced restore procedure

In addition to the basic restore, an advanced option is available if you have more than one YugabyteDB Anywhere installation and want to restore a database or keyspace from a different YugabyteDB Anywhere installation to the current universe. 

To perform this type of restore, click **... > Advanced Restore**, as per the following illustration:

![Restore advanced - YSQL](/images/yp/restore-advanced.png)<br>

To proceed, complete the fields of the **Advanced Restore** dialog shown in the following illustration:

![Restore advanced - YSQL](/images/yp/restore-advanced-ysql.png)<br>

- Select YSQL as the type of API.

- Specify the location of the backup you want to restore.

- Select the cloud provider-specific configuration of the backup storage. The storage could be on Google Cloud, Amazon S3, Azure, or Network File System. 

- Specify the name of the database from which you are performing a restore.

- Optionally, specify the number of parallel threads that are allowed to run. This can be any number between 1 and 100.

- Optionally, if the backup involved universes that had [encryption at rest enabled](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/yugabyte-platform/security/enable-encryption-at-rest), then select the KMS configuration to use.

- If you do not select **Rename databases in this backup before restoring**, then click **Restore** to start the restore process immediately.<br>

  If you select **Rename databases in this backup before restoring**, then click **Next: Rename Database/Keyspaces**, specify the new name for a keyspace or database in the backup and click **Restore**.

You can access a list of all backups from all universes by navigating to **Backups** on the YugabyteDB Anywhere left-side menu, as per the following illustration:
