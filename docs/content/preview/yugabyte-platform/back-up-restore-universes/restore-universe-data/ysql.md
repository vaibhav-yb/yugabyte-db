## Basic restore procedure

You can restore YugabyteDB universe YSQL data from a backup as follows:

1. Open your universe and select **Backups**.

2. If you want to restore a backup from a specific keyspace, click on the backup and use its **Backup Details** page to perform the restore procedure.

3. If you want to restore a complete backup, use the **Backups** page to select the backup and click its **... > Restore Entire Backup**, as per the following illustration:<br>

    ![Restore backup](/images/yp/restore-entire-backup-ysql.png)

    Complete the fields of the **Restore Backup** dialog, as follows:

    - Select the name of the universe to which you want to restore the backup.

    - Optionally and depending on your cloud provider, if the backup was from a universe that has [encryption at rest enabled](../../../security/enable-encryption-at-rest), then select the KMS configuration to use.

    - Refrain from selecting **Rename databases in this backup before restoring**.

    - Optionally, specify the number of parallel threads that are allowed to run. This can be any number between 1 and 100.

    - Click **Restore**.<br>

      The restore begins immediately. When finished, a completed **Restore Backup** task appears under **Tasks > Task History**.

4. If your backup includes incremental backups, you can either restore the complete backup, as per step 3, or restore a part of an incremental backup chain by selecting an increment from the list in the **Backup Details** view and clicking its **Restore to this point**.

    During the restore, only successful complete and incremental backups are used, whereas failed backups are discarded.

5. To confirm that the restore succeeded, select **Tables** to compare the original table with the table to which you restored.

## Advanced restore procedure

In addition to the basic restore, an advanced option is available if you have more than one YugabyteDB Anywhere installation and want to restore a database or keyspace from a different YugabyteDB Anywhere installation to the current universe.

To perform this type of restore, click **... > Advanced Restore**, as per the following illustration:

![Restore advanced - YSQL](/images/yp/restore-backup-advanced-ysql.png)

To proceed, complete the fields of the **Advanced Restore** dialog shown in the following illustration:

![Restore advanced - YSQL](/images/yp/restore-advanced-ysql.png)

- Select YSQL as the type of API.

- Specify the location of the backup you want to restore.

- Select the cloud provider-specific configuration of the backup storage. The storage could be on Google Cloud, Amazon S3, Azure, or Network File System.

- Specify the name of the database from which you are performing a restore.

- Optionally, specify the number of parallel threads that are allowed to run. This can be any number between 1 and 100.

- Optionally, if the backup involved universes that had [encryption at rest enabled](/preview/yugabyte-platform/security/enable-encryption-at-rest), then select the KMS configuration to use.

- If you do not select **Rename databases in this backup before restoring**, then click **Restore** to start the restore process immediately.<br>

  If you select **Rename databases in this backup before restoring**, then click **Next: Rename Database/Keyspaces**, specify the new name for a keyspace or database in the backup and click **Restore**.

<br>You can access a list of all backups from all universes by navigating to **Backups** on the YugabyteDB Anywhere left-side menu, as per the following illustration:

![Backups](/images/yp/backups-list.png)

By clicking on a specific universe included in the list, you can access the backup details and trigger a restore.
