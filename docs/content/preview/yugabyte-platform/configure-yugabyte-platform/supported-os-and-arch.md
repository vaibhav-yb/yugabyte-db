## Supported CPU architectures

YugabyteDB Anywhere supports deploying YugabyteDB on both x86 and ARM (aarch64) architecture-based hardware.

## Supported operating systems

YugabyteDB Anywhere supports deploying YugabyteDB on the following operating systems:

* AlmaLinux OS 8 (default)
* CentOS
* Oracle Linux 7
* Oracle Linux 8
* Ubuntu 18
* Ubuntu 20
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

### Requirements for all OSes

Python 3 is required. If you're using YugabyteDB Anywhere to provision nodes in public clouds, be sure the custom AMI you plan to use has Python 3 installed.

The host AMI must have `gtar` and `zipinfo` installed.

### Oracle Linux and AlmaLinux notes

YugabyteDB Anywhere support for Oracle Linux 8 and AlmaLinux OS 8 has the following limitations:

* Oracle Linux 8 uses the `firewall-cmd` client to set default target `ACCEPT`.
* On Oracle Linux 8, only the Red Hat Linux-compatible kernel is supported, to allow port changing. The Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) is not supported.
* Systemd services are only supported in YugabyteDB Anywhere 2.15.1 and later versions.
