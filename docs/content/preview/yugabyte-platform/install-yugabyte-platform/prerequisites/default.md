You can install YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA) using the following methods:

| Method | Using | Use If |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| YBA Installer | yba-ctl CLI | You are performing a new installation. |
| Replicated | Docker containers | Your installation already uses Replicated. |
| Kubernetes | Helm chart | You're deploying in Kubernetes. |

All installation methods support installing YBA with and without (airgapped) Internet connectivity.

Licensing (such as a license file in the case of YBA Installer or Replicated, or appropriate repository access in the case of Kubernetes) may be required prior to installation. Contact {{% support-platform %}} for assistance.

- Alma Linux 8
- Alma Linux 9
- Ubuntu 18
- Ubuntu 20
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 7
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 8
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15 SP4 (Tech Preview)

## Hardware requirements

A node running YugabyteDB Anywhere is expected to meet the following requirements:

- 4 cores
- 8 GB memory
- 200 GB disk space

## Prepare the host

YugabyteDB Anywhere uses [Replicated scheduler](https://www.replicated.com/) for software distribution and container management. You need to ensure that the host can pull containers from the [Replicated Docker Registries](https://help.replicated.com/docs/native/getting-started/docker-registries/).

Replicated installs a compatible Docker version if it is not pre-installed on the host. The currently supported Docker version is 20.10.n.

### Airgapped hosts

Installing YugabyteDB Anywhere on airgapped hosts (without access to any Internet traffic (inbound or outbound)) requires the following additional configuration:

- Whitelist endpoints: To install Replicated and YugabyteDB Anywhere on a host with no Internet connectivity, you have to first download the binaries on a computer that has Internet connectivity, and then copy the files over to the appropriate host. In case of restricted connectivity, whitelist the following endpoints to ensure that they are accessible from the host marked for installation:

  - `https://downloads.yugabyte.com`
  - `https://download.docker.com`

- Ensure that Docker Engine version 20.10.n is available. If it is not installed, you need to follow the procedure described in [Installing Docker in airgapped](https://community.replicated.com/t/installing-docker-in-airgapped-environments/81).

    If you want to set up Docker on Amazon Linux OS, perform the following:

    1. Install Docker using the following commands:

        ```sh
        sudo yum install docker
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        ```

    1. Start Docker using the following command:

        ```sh
        sudo systemctl start docker.service
        ```

- Ensure that the following ports are open on the YugabyteDB Anywhere host:
  - 8800 – HTTP access to the Replicated UI
  - 80 or 443 – HTTP and HTTPS access to the YugabyteDB Anywhere UI, respectively
  - 22 – SSH
- Obtain the YugabyteDB Anywhere airgapped install package. Contact {{% support-platform %}} for more information.
- Sign the Yugabyte license agreement. Contact {{% support-platform %}} for more information.
