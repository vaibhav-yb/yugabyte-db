You can upgrade your air-gapped installation of YugabyteDB Anywhere to a newer version as follows:

1. Manually obtain and move the binary Replicated license file `<filename>.rli` to the `/home/{username}/`  directory. 

2. Manually obtain and move the YugabyteDB Anywhere air-gapped package to the `/opt/yugabyte/releases/<new_version_dir>` directory. For example, if you are upgrading to the YugabyteDB Anywhere version 2.14, you would perform start by xecuting the following command to obtain the package:

   ```sh
   wget https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.14.0.0/yugaware-2.14.0.0-b94-linux-x86_64.airgap
   ```

   Then you would create the `/opt/yugabyte/releases/yugaware-2.14.0.0-b94/` directory and move (or SCP) the `yugaware-2.14.0.0-b94-linux-x86_64.airgap` file into that directory.

3. Log in to the Replicated Admin Console at <https://:8800/> and navigate to **Settings** to load the new license file, as per the following illustration:

   Change the two directories to match the ones you used. For example, enter `/opt/yugabyte/releases/yugaware-2.14.0.0-b94/` in the **Update Path** field and `/home/{user}/` in the **License File** field.

   Replicated detects updates based on the updated path information and applies them in the same way it does for connected YugabyteDB Anywhere installations.

4. Proceed with the YugabyteDB Anywhere upgrade process by following instructions provided in 
   [Upgrade YugabyteDB Anywhere using Replicated](../upgrade-yp-replicated/). 

5. Upgrade your YugabyteDB universe by following instructions provided in [Upgrade the YugabyteDB software](../../manage-deployments/upgrade-software/).
