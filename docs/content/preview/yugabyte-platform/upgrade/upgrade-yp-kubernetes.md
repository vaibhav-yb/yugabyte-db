You can use [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to upgrade your YugabyteDB Anywhere installed on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to a newer version.

Before running an upgrade, execute the following command to obtain the latest versions of YugabyteDB Anywhere from Helm charts:

```sh
helm repo update
```

To upgrade to a specific version while preserving overrides you might have applied to your initial YugabyteDB Anywhere installation or previous upgrades, execute the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade yw-test yugabytedb/yugaware --version 2.15.2 -n yb-platform --reuse-values --set image.tag=2.15.2.0-b87 --wait
```

To obtain the value for `--set image.tag`, execute the following command:

```sh
helm list | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $NF}'
```

If you do not wish to port your overrides, do not include `reuse-values`. Instead, you may choose to pass your existing overrides file by adding `--values custom-values.yaml` to your command during the upgrade.

If you have upgraded YugabyteDB Anywhere to version 2.12 or later and [xCluster replication](../../../explore/multi-region-deployments/asynchronous-replication-ysql/) for your universe was set up via `yb-admin` instead of the UI, follow the instructions provided in [Synchronize replication after upgrade](../upgrade-yp-xcluster-ybadmin/).
