YugabyteDB Voyager is a powerful open-source data migration engine that accelerates cloud native adoption by removing barriers to moving applications to the public or private cloud. It helps you migrate databases to YugabyteDB quickly and securely.

![Voyager Architecture](/images/migrate/voyager-architecture.png)

You manage the entire lifecycle of a database migration, including cluster preparation for data import, schema migration, and data migration, using the [yb-voyager](https://github.com/yugabyte/yb-voyager) command line interface (CLI).

## Features

YugabyteDB Voyager has the following features:

- Free and completely open source.
- Supports widely-used databases for migration and, in most cases, doesn't require changes to the [source databases](#source-databases).
- Supports all YugabyteDB products as the [target database](#target-database). The target needs to be running YugabyteDB stable versions 2.14.5.0 and later, and preview versions 2.17.0.0 and later.
- [Unified CLI](../reference/yb-voyager-cli/) experience for all different source databases.
- [Auto-tuneable](../performance/) based on workloads, by analyzing the target cluster capacity; runs parallel jobs by default.
- Progress monitoring, including the expected time for data export and import to complete, using progress bars.
- In case of failures, data import can be resumed.
- Parallelism of data across tables.
- Support for direct data import from CSV or TEXT format files present on local disk or on any cloud storage.
- Live migration with fall-forward is supported for Oracle (Tech Preview).

## Migration types

You can perform migration by choosing one of the following options:

- [Offline migration](../migrate/migrate-steps/) - Take your applications offline to perform the migration.
- [Live migration](../migrate/live-migrate/) [Tech Preview] - Migrate your data while your application is running (currently Oracle only).
- [Live migration with fall-forward](../migrate/live-fall-forward/) [Tech Preview] - Add a fall-forward database for your live migration (currently Oracle only).

## Source databases
