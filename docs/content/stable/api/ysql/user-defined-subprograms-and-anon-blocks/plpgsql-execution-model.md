## What does creating or replacing a subprogram do?

The SQL statements `create [or replace] function` and `create [or replace] procedure` do no more than a syntax check. If the check fails, then the statement has no effect. An error-free `create` will store the subprogram's definition in the catalog as its source text and other attributes spread among suitable dedicated columns in _[pg_proc](../pg-proc-catalog-table/)_. And a `create` that fails will leave _pg_proc_ unchanged. Similarly, an error-free `create or replace` will update the subprogram's row in _pg_proc_; and a `create or replace` will leave the subprogram's existing row unchanged.

## Execution model

This wording is taken (but re-written slightly) from the section [PL/pgSQL under the Hood](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/plpgsql-implementation.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation:

> The first time that a subprogram is called _within each session_. the PL/pgSQL interpreter fetches the subprogram's definition from _pg_proc_, parses the source text, and produces an _abstract syntax tree_ (a.k.a. _AST_). The AST fully translates the PL/pgSQL statement structure and control flow, but individual expressions and complete SQL statements used in the subprogram are not translated immediately. (Every PL/pgSQL expression is evaluated as a SQL expression.)
>
> As each expression and SQL statement is first executed in the subprogram, the PL/pgSQL interpreter parses and analyzes it to create a prepared statement.

Successive subsequent executions of a particular subprogram in a particular session will, in general, prepare more and more of its SQL statements and expressions as each new execution takes a different control-flow path.

This model brings huge understandability and usability benefits to the application developer:

- The identical set of data types, with identical semantics, is available in both top-level SQL and in PL/pgSQL.
- Expression syntax and semantics are identical in both top-level SQL and in PL/pgSQL.

But the model also brings the application developer some drawbacks:

- Errors in a specific expression or SQL statement cannot be detected until runtime, and then not until (or unless) it is reachedâ€”according to the current execution's control flow. Some particular error might therefore remain undetected for a long time, even after a subprogram is deployed into the production system.

- You must track functional dependencies like subprogram-upon-table, subprogram-upon-subprogram, and so on manually in your own external documentation. And you must drive your plan for making the cascade of accommodating changes to the closure of _functionally_ dependent subprograms, when an object is changed, entirely from this documentation.
