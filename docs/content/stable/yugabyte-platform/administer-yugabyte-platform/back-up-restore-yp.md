<br>YugabyteDB Anywhere installations include configuration settings, certificates and keys, as well as other components required for creating and managing YugabyteDB universes.

You can use the YugabyteDB Anywhere `yb_platform_backup.sh` script to back up an existing YugabyteDB Anywhere server and restore it, when needed, for disaster recovery or migrating to a new server.

## Prerequisites

To perform backups and restores in a Replicated environment, you must have a permission to run `docker` commands. This means that on systems with the default `docker` configuration, the `yb_platform_backup.sh` backup and restore script must be run using `sudo` or run as the `root` user (or another member of the `docker` group).

## Back up a YugabyteDB Anywhere server

To back up the YugabyteDB Anywhere server, perform the following:

- Copy the YugabyteDB Anywhere backup script `yb_platform_backup.sh` from the `yugabyte-db` repository using the following `wget` command:

    ```sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/managed/devops/bin/yb_platform_backup.sh
    ```

- Run the `yb_platform_backup.sh` script using the `backup` command, as follows:

    ```sh
    ./yb_platform_backup.sh create --output <output_path> [--data_dir <data_dir>] [--exclude_prometheus]
    ```

    *create* runs the backup of the YugabyteDB Anywhere server.<br>

    *output_path* specifies the location for the `.tar` output file.<br>

    *data_dir* is optional. It specifies the data directory to be backed up. Default is `/opt/yugabyte`.<br>

    *--exclude_prometheus* is optional. It excludes Prometheus metrics from the backup.

- Verify that the backup `.tar` file, with the correct timestamp, is in the specified output directory.

- Upload the backup file to your preferred storage location and delete it from the local disk.

## Restore a YugabyteDB Anywhere server

To restore the YugabyteDB Anywhere content from your saved backup, perform the following:

- Copy the `yb_platform_backup.sh` script from the `yugabyte-db` repository using the following `wget` command:

    ```sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/managed/devops/bin/yb_platform_backup.sh
    ```

- Copy the backup `.tar` file from your storage location.

- Run the `yb_platform_backup.sh` script using the `restore` command:

    ```sh
    ./yb_platform_backup.sh restore --input <input_path> [--destination <destination>]
    ```

    *restore* restores the YugabyteDB Anywhere content.<br>

    *input_path* is the path to the input `.tar` file.<br>

    *destination* is optional. It specifies the output location for data. Default is `/opt/yugabyte`.

Upon completion of the preceding steps, the restored YugabyteDB Anywhere is ready to continue managing your universes and clusters.
