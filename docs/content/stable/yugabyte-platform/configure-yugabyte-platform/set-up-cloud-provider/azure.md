<br>You can configure an Azure cloud provider for YugabyteDB clusters using YugabyteDB Anywhere.

## Prerequisites

You need to add the following cloud provider credentials via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

* Subscription ID
* Tenant ID
* SSH port and user
* Application client ID and secret
* Resource group

YugabyteDB Anywhere uses the credentials to automatically provision and deprovision YugabyteDB instances.

When the configuration is completed, you can see all the resources managed by YugabyteDB Anywhere in your resource group, including virtual machines, network interface, network security groups, public IP addresses, and disks.

## Configure Azure

You configure the Microsoft Azure cloud provider by completing the fields of the configuration page shown in the following illustration:

![Prepare Azure cloud to install YugabyteDB Anywhere](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/platform-azure-prepare-cloud-env-4.png)<br>

- **Provider Name** translates to an internal YugabyteDB Anywhere tag used for organizing cloud providers.
- **Subscription ID** is required for cost management. The virtual machine resources managed by YugabyteDB Anywhere are tagged with this subscription.
- **Resource Group** represents the group in which YugabyteDB nodes compute and network resources are created. Your Azure Active Directory application (client ID and client secret) needs to have `Network Contributor` and `Virtual Machine Contributor` roles assigned for this resource group.
- **Tenant ID** represents the Azure Active Directory tenant ID which belongs to an active subscription. To find your tenant ID, follow instructions provided in [Microsoft Azure: Tenant and application ID values for signing in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in).
- **SSH Port** allows you to specify the connection port number if you use custom images. The default port is 54422.
- **SSH User** represents the user name for the **SSH Port**.
- **Client ID** represents the [ID of an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) registered in your Azure Active Directory.
- **Client Secret** represents the secret of an application registered in your Azure Active Directory. You need to enter the `Value` of the secret (not the `Secret ID`).
- **Private DNS zone** lets you use a custom domain name for the nodes in your universe. For details and instructions, see [Define a private DNS zone](#define-a-private-dns-zone).
- **Virtual Network Setup** allows you to customize your network, including the virtual network, as follows:
  - Select an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
  - Create a new VPC. Note that this option is considered beta and is not recommended for production use cases, as creating a new VPC can silently fail if there are any classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) conflicts. For example, the following will result in a silent failure:
    - Configure more than one Azure cloud provider with different CIDR block prefixes and selecting the **Create a new VPC** option.
    - Creating a new VPC with an CIDR block that overlaps with any of the existing subnets.
- **NTP Setup** lets you to customize the Network Time Protocol server, as follows:
  - Select **Use provider’s NTP server** to enable cluster nodes to connect to the Azure internal time servers. For more information, consult the Microsoft Azure documentation such as [Time sync for Linux VMs in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/time-sync).
  - Select **Manually add NTP Servers** to provide your own NTP servers and allow the cluster nodes to connect to those NTP servers.
  - Select **Don’t set up NTP** to prevent YugabyteDB Anywhere from performing any NTP configuration on the cluster nodes. For data consistency, ensure that NTP is correctly configured on your machine image.

### Obtain Azure resource IDs

To find an Azure resource's ID, navigate to the resource in question and click **JSON View** at the top right, as per the following illustration:

![JSON view link on a resource](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/resource-get-json.png)

Azure resource IDs typically have the following format:

```output
/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.<service>/path/to/resource
```

### Define a private DNS zone

You may choose to define a private DNS zone to instruct YugabyteDB Anywhere to register the universe name to all of the IP addresses in the universe within that DNS zone. For more information, see [What is a private Azure DNS zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone).

You can set a private DNS zone as follows:

1. On the Azure portal, create the Private DNS Zone, as per the following illustration:<br>

    ![Private DNS: basics tab](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/private-dns-basics-tab.png)<br>

1. Navigate to the resource page and click **Settings > Virtual Network Links**, as per the following illustration:<br>

    ![Resource menu](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/resource-menu.png)<br>

1. Add a link to the virtual network to which you want it to be connected. For more information, see [Create an Azure private DNS zone using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal).

1. To use the private DNS zone in YugabyteDB Anywhere, add either the resource ID or the name of the DNS zone to the **Private DNS Zone** field of the **Cloud Provider Configuration** page in the YugabyteDB Anywhere UI.<br>

    If the private DNS zone is defined by an ID, YugabyteDB Anywhere will use it together with the default subscription ID and the resource group. If the private DNS zone is defined by a full URL that contains both the subscription ID and resource group, then these two values will be used instead of default values.

In the setup example shown in the following illustration, the private DNS zone is specified as `dns.example.com`, and the resource group is explicitly specified as `myRG`:

![Private DNS setup example](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/private-dns-myrg.png)

In the following setup example, a complete resource ID is specified for the private DNS zone:

```output
/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/different-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/dns.example.com
```

The preceding setting specifies the resource group as `different-rg` and the DNS zone as `dns.example.com`. The `different-rg` resource group in the resource ID overrides the setting in the **Resource Group** field, as shown in the following illustration:

![img](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/private-dns-myrg-2.png)

## Specify region

You can specify a region as follows:

1. Click **Add Region**.

1. Use the **Specify Region Info** dialog to select a region and provide a virtual network name from your Azure portal.

1. Optionally, specify the security group, if the database VM is in a different network than YugabyteDB Anywhere.

1. Provide a URN to a marketplace image or a shared gallery image by following instructions provided in [Use a shared image gallery](#use-a-shared-image-gallery). If you are using custom images, you need to specify the SSH port and user, as described in [Configure Azure](#configure-azure).

1. Provide a mapping of subnet IDs to use for each availability zone you wish to deploy. This is required for ensuring that YugabyteDB Anywhere can deploy nodes in the correct network isolation that you need in your environment.

   ![Prepare Azure cloud to install YugabyteDB Anywhere](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/platform-azure-prepare-cloud-env-5.png)

1. Click **Add Region** on the **Specify Region Info** dialog.

1. Click **Save** on the **Cloud Provider Configuration** page.

Typically, it takes a few minutes for the cloud provider to be configured. When the configuration completes, you will be ready to create a YugabyteDB universe on Azure.

If you encounter problems, see [Troubleshoot Azure cloud provider configuration](../../../troubleshoot/cloud-provider-config-issues/#azure-cloud-provider-configuration-problems).

### Use a shared image gallery

You can use shared image galleries as an alternative to using marketplace image URNs. A gallery allows you to provide your own custom image to use for creating universe instances. For more information on shared image galleries, refer to [Store and share images in an Azure Compute Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries).

You set up a shared gallery image on Azure as follows:

1. On the Azure portal, create a shared image gallery.

1. Create an image definition.

1. Create a VM of which you want to take a snapshot.

1. Navigate to the VM and click **Capture** on the top menu.

1. Fill in the information and then choose the gallery and image definition you created in the previous steps, as per the following illustration:<br>

    ![img](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/shared-gallery-capture.png)

    Ensure that the images are replicated to each region in which you are planning to use them. For example, configuration shown in the following illustration would only work for US East:

    ![description](/images/yb-platform/install/azure/shared-gallery-replication.png)

1. To use the image in YugabyteDB Anywhere, enter the image version's resource ID into the **Marketplace Image URN / Shared Gallery Image ID** field of the **Specify Region Info** dialog.

   <br>The gallery image ID could be defined by a full URL containing a subscription ID, a resource group name, and the resource name itself. If the subscription ID or the resource group is different from the default values, YugabyteDB Anywhere will use them instead.
