<br>This document describes how to configure the Kubernetes provider for YugabyteDB universes using YugabyteDB Anywhere. If no cloud providers are configured in YugabyteDB Anywhere yet, the main **Dashboard** page prompts you to configure at least one cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

To run YugabyteDB universes on Kubernetes, all you need to provide in YugabyteDB Anywhere is your Kubernetes provider credentials. YugabyteDB Anywhere uses those credentials to automatically provision and de-provision the pods that run YugabyteDB.

Before you install YugabyteDB on a Kubernetes cluster, perform the following:

- Create a `yugabyte-platform-universe-management` service account.
- Create a `kubeconfig` file of the earlier-created service account to configure access to the Kubernetes cluster.

### Service account

The secret of a service account can be used to generate a `kubeconfig` file. This account should not be deleted once it is in use by YugabyteDB Anywhere.

Set the `YBA_NAMESPACE` environment variable to the namespace where your YugabyteDB Anywhere is installed, as follows:

```sh
export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"
```

Note that the `YBA_NAMESPACE` variable is used in the commands throughout this document.

Run the following `kubectl` command to apply the YAML file:

```sh
export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/yugabyte-platform-universe-management-sa.yaml -n ${YBA_NAMESPACE}
```

Expect the following output:

```output
serviceaccount/yugabyte-platform-universe-management created
```

The next step is to grant access to this service account using ClusterRoles and Roles, as well as ClusterRoleBindings and RoleBindings, thus allowing it to manage the YugabyteDB universe's resources for you.

The namespace in the following commands needs to be replaced with the correct namespace of the previously created service account.

The tasks you can perform depend on your access level.

**Global Admin** can grant broad cluster level admin access by executing the following command:

```sh
export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/platform-global-admin.yaml \
  | sed "s/namespace: <SA_NAMESPACE>/namespace: ${YBA_NAMESPACE}"/g \
  | kubectl apply -n ${YBA_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

**Global Restricted** can grant access to only the specific cluster roles to create and manage YugabyteDB universes across all the namespaces in a cluster using the following command:

```sh
export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/platform-global.yaml \
  | sed "s/namespace: <SA_NAMESPACE>/namespace: ${YBA_NAMESPACE}"/g \
  | kubectl apply -n ${YBA_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

This contains ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings for the required set of permissions.

**Namespace Admin** can grant namespace-level admin access by using the following command:

```sh
export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/platform-namespaced-admin.yaml \
  | sed "s/namespace: <SA_NAMESPACE>/namespace: ${YBA_NAMESPACE}"/g \
  | kubectl apply -n ${YBA_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

If you have multiple target namespaces, then you have to apply the YAML in all of them.

**Namespace Restricted** can grant access to only the specific roles required to create and manage YugabyteDB universes in a particular namespace. Contains Roles and RoleBindings for the required set of permissions.

For example, if your goal is to allow YugabyteDB Anywhere to manage YugabyteDB universes in the namespaces `yb-db-demo` and `yb-db-us-east4-a` (the target namespaces), then you need to apply in both the target namespaces, as follows:

```sh
export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/platform-namespaced.yaml \
  | sed "s/namespace: <SA_NAMESPACE>/namespace: ${YBA_NAMESPACE}"/g \
  | kubectl apply -n ${YBA_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

### kubeconfig file

You can create a `kubeconfig` file for the previously created `yugabyte-platform-universe-management` service account as follows:

1. Run the following `wget` command to get the Python script for generating the `kubeconfig` file:

    ```sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YugaByte/charts/master/stable/yugabyte/generate_kubeconfig.py
    ```

2. Run the following command to generate the `kubeconfig` file:

    ```sh
    export YBA_NAMESPACE="yb-platform"

    python generate_kubeconfig.py -s yugabyte-platform-universe-management -n ${YBA_NAMESPACE}
    ```

    Expect the following output:

    ```output
    Generated the kubeconfig file: /tmp/yugabyte-platform-universe-management.conf
    ```

3. Use this generated `kubeconfig` file as the `kubeconfig` in the YugabyteDB Anywhere Kubernetes provider configuration.

## Select the Kubernetes service

In the YugabyteDB Anywhere UI, navigate to **Configs > Cloud Provider Configuration > Managed Kubernetes Service** and select one of the Kubernetes service providers using the **Type** field, as per the following illustration:<br>

![Kubernetes config](/images/ee/k8s-setup/k8s-configure-empty.png)

## Configure the cloud provider

Continue configuring your Kubernetes provider as follows:

- Specify a meaningful name for your configuration.
- Choose one of the following ways to specify **Kube Config** for an availability zone:
  - Specify at **provider level** in the provider form. If specified, this configuration file is used for all availability zones in all regions.
  - Specify at **zone level** in the region form. This is required for **multi-az** or **multi-region** deployments.
- In the **Service Account** field, provide the name of the service account which has necessary access to manage the cluster (see [Create cluster](../../../../deploy/kubernetes/single-zone/oss/helm-chart/#create-cluster)).
- In the **Image Registry** field, specify from where to pull the YugabyteDB image. Accept the default setting, unless you are hosting the registry, in which case refer to steps described in [Pull and push YugabyteDB Docker images to private container registry](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/prerequisites#pull-and-push-yugabytedb-docker-images-to-private-container-registry).
- Use **Pull Secret File** to upload the pull secret to download the image of the Enterprise YugabyteDB that is in a private repository. Your Yugabyte sales representative should have provided this secret.

## Configure region and zones

Continue configuring your Kubernetes provider by clicking **Add region** and completing the **Add new region** dialog, as follows:

- Use the **Region** field to select the region.

- Use the **Zone** field to select a zone label that should match with your failure domain zone label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`.

- Optionally, use the **Storage Class** field to enter a comma-delimited value. If you do not specify this value, it would default to standard. You need to ensure that this storage class exists in your Kubernetes cluster and the storage class is based on [storage class considerations](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/prepare-environment/kubernetes/#storage-class-considerations).

- Use the **Namespace** field to specify the namespace. If provided service account has the `Cluster Admin` permissions, you are not required to complete this field. The service account used in the provided `kubeconfig` file should have access to this namespace.

- Use **Kube Config** to upload the configuration file. If this file is available at provider level, you are not required to supply it.<br>

  ![Add new region](/images/ee/k8s-setup/k8s-az-kubeconfig.png)<br>

- Complete the **Overrides** field using one of the provided options. If you do not specify anything, YugabyteDB Anywhere would use defaults specified inside the Helm chart. The following overrides are available:

  - Overrides to add service-level annotations:

    ```yml
    serviceEndpoints:
      - name: "yb-master-service"
        type: "LoadBalancer"
        annotations:
          service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "0.0.0.0/0"
        app: "yb-master"
        ports:
          ui: "7000"

      - name: "yb-tserver-service"
        type: "LoadBalancer"
        annotations:
          service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "0.0.0.0/0"
        app: "yb-tserver"
        ports:
          ycql-port: "9042"
          yedis-port: "6379"
          ysql-port: "5433"
    ```

  - Overrides to disable LoadBalancer:

    ```yml
    enableLoadBalancer: False
    ```

  - Overrides to change the cluster domain name:

    ```yml
    domainName: my.cluster
    ```

  - Overrides to add annotations at StatefulSet-level:

    ```yml
    networkAnnotation:
      annotation1: 'foo'
      annotation2: 'bar'
    ```

  - Overrides to add custom resource allocation for YB master and TServer pods and it overrides the instance types selected in the Yugabyte universe creation flow:

    ```yml
    resource:
      master:
        requests:
          cpu: 2
          memory: 2Gi
        limits:
          cpu: 2
          memory: 2Gi
      tserver:
        requests:
          cpu: 2
          memory: 4Gi
        limits:
          cpu: 2
          memory: 4Gi
    ```

  - Overrides to enable Istio compatibility (required when Istio is used with Kubernetes):

    ```yml
    istioCompatibility: enabled: true
    ```

  - Overrides to publish Node-IP as the server broadcast address.

    By default, Master and T-Server pod fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) are used within the cluster as the server broadcast address. To publish the IPs of the nodes on which YugabyteDB TServer pods are deployed, add the following YAML to each zone override configuration:

    ```yml
    tserver:
      extraEnv:
      - name: NODE_IP
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: status.hostIP
      serverBroadcastAddress: "$(NODE_IP)"
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - "yb-tserver"
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

    # Required to esure that the Kubernetes FQDNs are used for
    # internal communication between the nodes and node-to-node
    # TLS certificates are validated correctly.

    gflags:
      master:
        use_private_ip: cloud
      tserver:
        use_private_ip: cloud

    serviceEndpoints:
      - name: "yb-master-ui"
        type: LoadBalancer
        app: "yb-master"
        ports:
          http-ui: "7000"

      - name: "yb-tserver-service"
        type: NodePort
        externalTrafficPolicy: "Local"
        app: "yb-tserver"
        ports:
          tcp-yql-port: "9042"
          tcp-yedis-port: "6379"
          tcp-ysql-port: "5433"
    ```

  - Overrides to run YugabyteDB as a non-root user:

    ```yml
    podSecurityContext:
      enabled: true
      ## Set to false to stop the non-root user validation
      runAsNonRoot: true
      fsGroup: 10001
      runAsUser: 10001
      runAsGroup: 10001
    ```
    Note that you cannot change users during the Helm upgrades.

  - Add `tolerations` in Master and Tserver pods. Tolerations work in combination with taints. `Taints` are applied on nodes and `Tolerations` to pods. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods do not schedule onto inappropriate nodes. You need to set `nodeSelector` to schedule YugabyteDB pods onto specific nodes and use taints + tolerations to prevent other pods from getting scheduled on the dedicated nodes if required.
  For more information, see [Toleration API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#toleration-v1-core).

    ```yml
    ## Consider node has following taint.
    ## kubectl taint nodes node1 dedicated=experimental:NoSchedule-

    master:
      tolerations:
      - key: dedicated
        operator: Equal
        value: experimental
        effect: NoSchedule

    tserver:
      tolerations: []
    ```

  - You can use `nodeSelector` to schedule Master and TServer pods on dedicated nodes. For more information, see [Node Selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

    ```yml
    ## The pod will get scheduled on a node that has a topology.kubernetes.io/zone=asia-south2-a label.
    nodeSelector:
      topology.kubernetes.io/zone: asia-south2-a
    ```

  - Add `affinity` in Master and TServer pods. The `affinity` allows the Kubernetes scheduler to place a pod on a set of nodes or a pod relative to the placement of other pods. You can use `nodeAffinity` rules to control pod placements on a set of nodes. In contrast, `podAffinity` or `podAntiAffinity` rules provide the ability to control pod placements relative to other pods. For more information, see [Affinity API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#affinity-v1-core).

    ```yml
    ## Following example can be used to prevent scheduling of multiple master pods on single kubernetes node.
    master:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - "yb-master"
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

    tserver:
      affinity: {}
    ```

  - Add `annotations` to Master and Tserver pods. The Kubernetes `annotations` can attach arbitrary metadata to objects. For more information, see [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/).

    ```yml
    master:
      podAnnotations:
        application: "yugabytedb"

    tserver:
      podAnnotations: {}
    ```

  - Add `labels` to Master and Tserver pods. The Kubernetes `labels` are key/value pairs attached to objects. The `labels` are used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to you. For more information, see [Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/).

    ```yml
    master:
      podLabels:
        environment: production
        app: yugabytedb
        prometheus.io/scrape: true

    tserver:
      podLabels: {}
    ```

  - You can use the following preflight checks to verify YugabyteDB prerequisites:
    1. DNS address resolution
    2. Disk IO
    3. Port available for bind
    4. Ulimit

    For more information, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/deploy/kubernetes/single-zone/oss/helm-chart/#prerequisites).

    ```yml
    ## Default values
    preflight:
      ## Set to true to skip disk IO check, DNS address resolution, and port bind checks
      skipAll: false

      ## Set to true to skip port bind checks
      skipBind: false

      ## Set to true to skip ulimit verification
      ## SkipAll has higher priority
      skipUlimit: false
    ```

Continue configuring your Kubernetes provider by clicking **Add Zone**, as per the following illustration:

![Add new region - multiple](/images/ee/k8s-setup/k8s-add-region-flow.png)

Notice that there are might be multiple zones.

Finally, click **Add Region**, and then click **Save** to save the configuration. If successful, you will be redirected to the table view of all configurations.
