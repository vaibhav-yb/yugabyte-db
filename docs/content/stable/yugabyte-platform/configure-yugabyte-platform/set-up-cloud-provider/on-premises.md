<br>You can configure the on-premises cloud provider for YugabyteDB using YugabyteDB Anywhere. If no cloud providers are configured, the main **Dashboard** prompts you to configure at least one cloud provider.

## Configure the on-premises provider

Configuring the on-premises provider consists of a number of steps.

### Complete the provider information

You need to navigate to **Configs > Infrastructure > On-Premises Datacenters**, click either **Add Configuration** or **Edit Provider**, and then complete the fields of the **Provider Info** form shown in the following illustration:

![Configure On-Premises Cloud Provider](/images/ee/onprem/configure-onprem-1.png)

- In the **Provider Name** field, supply the provider name, which is an internal tag that helps with organizing your providers, so you know where you want to deploy your YugabyteDB universes.

- In the **SSH User** field, enter the name of the user that has SSH privileges on your instances. This is required because to provision on-premises nodes with YugabyteDB, YugabyteDB Anywhere needs SSH access to these nodes. Unless you plan to provision the database nodes manually, the user needs to have password-free sudo permissions to complete a few tasks.

  If the SSH user requires a password for sudo access or the SSH user does not have sudo access, follow the steps described in [Manually provision nodes](#manually-provision-nodes).

- In the **SSH Port** field, provide the port number of SSH client connections.

- Enable the **Manually Provision Nodes** field if you choose to manually set up your database nodes. Otherwise, YugabyteDB Anywhere will use the sudo user to set up YugabyteDB nodes. For manual provisioning, you would be prompted to run a Python script at a later stage or to run a set of commands on the database nodes.

  If any of the following statements are applicable to your use case, you need to [provision the nodes manually](#provision-nodes-manually):

  - Preprovisioned `yugabyte:yugabyte` user and group.
  - Sudo user requires a password.
  - The SSH user is not a sudo user.

- Use the **SSH Key** field to enter the full content of the private key available to the SSH user for gaining access via SSH into your instances.

  Ensure that the SSH key is pasted correctly in the RSA format: you need to paste the SSH RSA PEM key entry including the RSA key header such as `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and footer such as `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

- Enable the **Air Gap Install** field if you want the installation to run in an air-gapped mode without expecting any internet access.

- Optionally, you may enable **Advanced** and complete the following:

  - Use the **Desired Home Directory** field to specify the home directory of the `yugabyte` user. The default value is `/home/yugabyte`.
  - Use the **Node Exporter Port** field to specify the port number for the node exporter. The default value is 9300.
  - Enable **Install Node Exporter** if you want the node exporter installed. You can skip this step if you have node exporter already installed on the nodes. Ensure you have provided the correct port number for skipping the installation.
  - The **Node Exporter User** field allows you to override the default Prometheus user. This is helpful when the user is preprovisioned on nodes (when the user creation is disabled). If overridden, the installer checks whether or not the user exists and creates the user if it does not exist.

- **NTP Setup** lets you to customize the Network Time Protocol server, as follows:

  - Select **Manually add NTP Servers** to provide your own NTP servers and allow the cluster nodes to connect to those NTP servers.
  - Select **Don't set up NTP** to prevent YugabyteDB Anywhere from performing any NTP configuration on the cluster nodes. For data consistency, ensure that NTP is correctly configured on your machine image.

### Configure hardware for YugabyteDB nodes

Complete the **Instance Types** fields, as per the following illustration, to provide node hardware configuration (CPU, memory, and volume information):

![Configure On-Premises Cloud Provider](/images/ee/onprem/configure-onprem-2.png)

- Use the **Machine Type** field to define a value to be used internally as an identifier in the **Instance Type** universe field.
- Use the **Num Cores** field to define the number of cores to be assigned to a node.
- Use the **Mem Size GB** field to define the memory allocation of a node.
- Use the **Vol Size GB** field to define the disk volume of a node.
- Use the **Mount Paths** field to define a mount point with enough space to contain your node density. Use `/data`. If you have multiple drives, add these as a comma-separated list, such as, for example, `/mnt/d0,/mnt/d1`.

### Define regions and zones

Complete the **Regions and Zones** fields, as per the following illustration, to provide the location of YugabyteDB nodes:

![Configure On-Premises Cloud Provider](/images/ee/onprem/configure-onprem-3.png)

YugabyteDB Anywhere will use these values during the universe creation.

## Add YugabyteDB nodes

After finishing the provider configuration, click **Manage Instances** to provision as many nodes as your application requires.

![Configure On-Premises Cloud Provider](/images/ee/onprem/configure-onprem-4.png)

For each node you want to add, click **Add Instances** to add a YugabyteDB node. You can use DNS names or IP addresses when adding instances (instance ID is an optional user-defined identifier).

![Configure On-Premises Cloud Provider](/images/ee/onprem/configure-onprem-5.png)

Note that if you provide a hostname, the universe might experience issues communicating. To resolve this, you need to delete the failed universe and then recreate it with the `use_node_hostname_for_local_tserver` g-flag enabled.

### Provision nodes manually

To provision your nodes manually, you have the following two options:

1. If the SSH user you provided has sudo privileges but requires a password, you can [run the preprovisioning script](#running-the-preprovisioning-script).
2. If the SSH user does not have any sudo privileges, you need to [set up the database nodes manually](#setting-up-database-nodes-manually).

#### Running the preprovisioning script

This step is only required if you set **Manually Provision Nodes** to true and the SSH user has sudo privileges which require a password; otherwise you skip this step.

You can manually provision each node using the preprovisioning Python script, as follows:

1. Login to YugabyteDB Anywhere virtual machine via SSH.

1. Access the Docker `yugaware` container, as follows:

    ```sh
    sudo docker exec -it yugaware bash
    ```

1. Copy and paste the Python script prompted via the UI and substitute for a node IP address and mount points.
Optionally, use the `--ask_password` flag if the sudo user requires password authentication, as follows:

    ```bash
    /opt/yugabyte/yugaware/data/provision/9cf26f3b-4c7c-451a-880d-593f2f76efce/provision_instance.py --ip 10.9.116.65 --mount_points /data --ask_password
    ```

    Expect the following output and prompt:

    ```output
    Executing provision now for instance with IP 10.9.116.65...
    SUDO password:
    ```

1. Wait for the script to finish successfully.

1. Repeat step 3 for every node that will participate in the universe.

This completes the on-premises cloud provider configuration. You can proceed to [Configure the backup target](../../backup-target/) or [Create deployments](../../../create-deployments/).

#### Setting up database nodes manually

This step is only required if you set **Manually Provision Nodes** to true and the SSH user does not have sudo privileges at all; otherwise you skip this step.

If the SSH user configured in the on-premises provider does not have sudo privileges, then you can set up each of the database nodes manually. Note that you need access to a user with sudo privileges in order to complete these steps.

For each node, perform the following:

- [Set up time synchronization](#set-up-time-synchronization)
- [Open incoming TCP ports](#open-incoming-tcp-ip-ports)
- [Preprovision the node](#preprovision-nodes-manually)
- [Install Prometheus node exporter](#install-prometheus-node-exporter)
- [Install backup utilities](#install-backup-utilities)
- [Set crontab permissions](#set-crontab-permissions)
- [Install systemd-related database service unit files (optional)](#install-systemd-related-database-service-unit-files)

##### Set up time synchronization

A local Network Time Protocol (NTP) server or equivalent must be available.

Ensure an NTP-compatible time service client is installed in the node OS (chrony is installed by default in the standard CentOS 7 instance used in this example). Then, configure the time service client to use the available time server. The procedure includes this step and assumes chrony is the installed client.

##### Open incoming TCP/IP ports

Database servers need incoming TCP/IP access enabled to the following ports, for communications between themselves and YugabyteDB Anywhere:

| Protocol | Port | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :---------- |
| TCP | 22 | SSH (for automatic administration) |
| TCP | 5433 | YSQL client |
| TCP | 6379 | YEDIS client |
| TCP | 7000 | YB master webserver |
| TCP | 7100 | YB master RPC |
| TCP | 9000 | YB tablet server webserver |
| TCP | 9042 | YCQL client |
| TCP | 9090 | Prometheus server |
| TCP | 9100 | YB tablet server RPC |
| TCP | 9300 | Prometheus node exporter |
| TCP | 12000 | YCQL HTTP (for DB statistics gathering) |
| TCP | 13000 | YSQL HTTP (for DB statistics gathering) |

The preceding table is based on the information on the [default ports page](/preview/reference/configuration/default-ports/).

##### Preprovision nodes manually

This process carries out all provisioning tasks on the database nodes which require elevated privileges. After the database nodes have been prepared in this way, the universe creation process from YugabyteDB Anywhere will connect with the nodes only via the `yugabyte` user, and not require any elevation of privileges to deploy and operate the YugabyteDB universe.

Physical nodes (or cloud instances) are installed with a standard CentOS 7 server image. The following steps are to be performed on each physical node, prior to universe creation:

1. Login to each database node as a user with sudo enabled (the `centos` user in centos7 images).

1. Add the following line to the `/etc/chrony.conf` file:

    ```text
    server <your-time-server-IP-address> prefer iburst
    ```

    Then run the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo chronyc makestep   # (force instant sync to NTP server)
    ```

1. Add a new `yugabyte:yugabyte` user and group with the default login shell `/bin/bash` that you set via the `-s` flag, as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -m yugabyte   # (add user yugabyte and create /home/yugabyte)
    sudo passwd yugabyte   # (add a password to the yugabyte user)
    sudo su - yugabyte   # (change to yugabyte user for execution of next steps)
    ```

    Ensure that the `yugabyte` user has permissions to SSH into the YugabyteDB nodes (as defined in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).

1. Copy the SSH public key to each DB node. This public key should correspond to the private key entered into the YugabyteDB Anywhere provider.

1. Run the following commands as the `yugabyte` user, after copying the SSH public key file to the user home directory:

    ```sh
    cd ~yugabyte
    mkdir .ssh
    chmod 700 .ssh
    cat <pubkey file> >> .ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 400 .ssh/authorized_keys
    exit   # (exit from the yugabyte user back to previous user)
    ```

1. Add the following lines to the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file (sudo is required):

    ```text
    *                -       core            unlimited
    *                -       data            unlimited
    *                -       fsize           unlimited
    *                -       sigpending      119934
    *                -       memlock         64
    *                -       rss             unlimited
    *                -       nofile          1048576
    *                -       msgqueue        819200
    *                -       stack           8192
    *                -       cpu             unlimited
    *                -       nproc           12000
    *                -       locks           unlimited
    ```

1. Modify the following line in the `/etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf` file:

    ```text
    *          soft    nproc     12000
    ```

1. Install the rsync and OpenSSL packages (if not already included with your Linux distribution) using the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo yum install openssl
    sudo yum install rsync
    ```

    For airgapped environments, make sure your Yum repository mirror contains these packages.

1. If running on a virtual machine, execute the following to tune kernel settings:

    ```sh
    sudo bash -c 'sysctl vm.swappiness=0 >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
    sudo sysctl kernel.core_pattern=/home/yugabyte/cores/core_%e.%p >> /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```

1. Perform the following to prepare and mount the data volume (separate partition for database data):

    - List the available storage volumes, as follows:

      ```sh
      lsblk
      ```

    - Perform the following steps for each available volume (all listed volumes other than the root volume):

      ```sh
      sudo mkdir /data   # (or /data1, /data2 etc)
      sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1   # (create xfs filesystem over entire volume)
      sudo vi /etc/fstab
      ```

    - Add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

      ```text
      /dev/nvme1n1   /data   xfs   noatime   0   0
      ```

    - Exit from vi, and continue, as follows:

      ```sh
      sudo mount -av # (mounts the new volume using the fstab entry, to validate)
      sudo chown yugabyte:yugabyte /data
      sudo chmod 755 /data
      ```

##### Install Prometheus node exporter

Download the 1.3.1 version of the Prometheus node exporter, as follows:

```sh
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.3.1/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

If you are doing an airgapped installation, download the node exporter using a computer connected to the internet and copy it over to the database nodes.

On each node, perform the following as a user with sudo access:

1. Copy the `node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.gz` package file that you downloaded into the `/tmp` directory on each of the YugabyteDB nodes. Ensure that this file is readable by the user (for example, `centos`).

1. Run the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir /opt/prometheus
    sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
    sudo mkdir /var/log/prometheus
    sudo mkdir /var/run/prometheus
    sudo mv /tmp/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar  /opt/prometheus
    sudo adduser --shell /bin/bash prometheus # (also adds group “prometheus”)
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /opt/prometheus
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/log/prometheus
    sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/run/prometheus
    sudo chmod +r /opt/prometheus/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar
    sudo su - prometheus (user session is now as user “prometheus”)
    ```

1. Run the following commands as user `prometheus`:

    ```sh
    cd /opt/prometheus
    tar zxf node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    exit   # (exit from prometheus user back to previous user)
    ```

1. Edit the following file:

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
    ```

    Add the following to the `/etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service` file:

    ```conf
    [Unit]
    Description=node_exporter - Exporter for machine metrics.
    Documentation=https://github.com/William-Yeh/ansible-prometheus
    After=network.target

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    User=prometheus
    Group=prometheus

    ExecStart=/opt/prometheus/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64/node_exporter  --web.listen-address=:9300 --collector.textfile.directory=/tmp/yugabyte/metrics
    ```

1. Exit from vi, and continue, as follows:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
    sudo systemctl start node_exporter
    ```

1. Check the status of the `node_exporter` service with the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status node_exporter
    ```

##### Install backup utilities

YugabyteDB Anywhere supports backing up YugabyteDB to Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and Network File System (NFS). For more information, see [Configure backup storage](../../../back-up-restore-universes/configure-backup-storage/).

You can install the backup utility for the backup storage you plan to use, as follows:

- NFS: Install rsync, which YugabyteDB Anywhere uses to perform NFS backups installed during one of the previous steps.

- Amazon S3: Install s3cmd, on which YugabyteDB Anywhere relies to support copying backups to Amazon S3. You have the following installation options:

  - For a regular installation, execute the following:

      ```sh
      sudo yum install s3cmd
      ```

  - For an airgapped installation, copy `/opt/third-party/s3cmd-2.0.1.tar.gz` from the YugabyteDB Anywhere node to the database node, and then extract it into the `/usr/local` directory on the database node, as follows:

      ```sh
      cd /usr/local
      sudo tar xvfz path-to-s3cmd-2.0.1.tar.gz
      sudo ln -s /usr/local/s3cmd-2.0.1/s3cmd /usr/local/bin/s3cmd
      ```

- Azure Storage: Install azcopy using one of the following options:

  - Download `azcopy_linux_amd64_10.13.0.tar.gz` using the following command:

      ```sh
      wget https://azcopyvnext.azureedge.net/release20211027/azcopy_linux_amd64_10.13.0.tar.gz
      ```

  - For airgapped installations, copy `/opt/third-party/azcopy_linux_amd64_10.13.0.tar.gz` from the YugabyteDB Anywhere node, as follows:

      ```sh
      cd /usr/local
      sudo tar xfz path-to-azcopy_linux_amd64_10.13.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin azcopy_linux_amd64_10.13.0/azcopy --strip-components 1
      ```

- Google Cloud Storage: Install gsutil using one of the following options:

  - Download `gsutil_4.60.tar.gz` using the following command:

      ```sh
      wget https://storage.googleapis.com/pub/gsutil_4.60.tar.gz
      ```

  - For airgapped installations, copy `/opt/third-party/gsutil_4.60.tar.gz` from the YugabyteDB Anywhere node, as follows:

      ```sh
      cd /usr/local
      sudo tar xvfz gsutil_4.60.tar.gz
      sudo ln -s /usr/local/gsutil/gsutil /usr/local/bin/gsutil
      ```

##### Set crontab permissions

YugabyteDB Anywhere supports performing YugabyteDB liveness checks, log file management, and core file management using cron jobs.

Note that sudo is required to set up this service.

If YugabyteDB Anywhere will be using cron jobs, ensure that the `yugabyte` user is allowed to run crontab:

- If you are using the `cron.allow` file to manage crontab access, add the `yugabyte` user to this file.
- If you are using the `cron.deny` file, remove the `yugabyte` user from this file.

If you are not using either file, no changes are required.

<!--

##### Manage liveness checks, logs, and cores

YugabyteDB Anywhere supports performing YugabyteDB liveness checks, log file management, and core file management using cron jobs or systemd services.

**Sudo is required to set up these services**

If YugabyteDB Anywhere will be using **cron jobs**, make sure the yugabyte user is allowed to run crontab. If you're using the cron.allow file to manage crontab access, add the yugabyte user to this file. If you're using the cron.deny file, remove the yugabyte user from this file.

YugabyteDB Anywhere **systemd services** to perform the monitoring operations mentioned above, then make sure ...
-->

You have finished configuring your on-premises cloud provider. Proceed to [Configure the backup target](../../backup-target/) or [Create deployments](../../../create-deployments/).

##### Install systemd-related database service unit files

As an alternative to setting crontab permissions, you can install systemd-specific database service unit files, as follows:

1. Enable the `yugabyte` user to run the following commands as sudo or root:

   ```sh
   yugabyte ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl start yb-master, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-master, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-master, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-master, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-master, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-tserver, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-tserver, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-tserver, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-tserver, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-tserver, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-zip_purge_yb_logs.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-zip_purge_yb_logs.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-zip_purge_yb_logs.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-zip_purge_yb_logs.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-zip_purge_yb_logs.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-clean_cores.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-clean_cores.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-clean_cores.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-clean_cores.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-clean_cores.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-collect_metrics.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-collect_metrics.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-collect_metrics.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-collect_metrics.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-collect_metrics.timer, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-zip_purge_yb_logs, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-zip_purge_yb_logs, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-zip_purge_yb_logs, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-zip_purge_yb_logs, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-zip_purge_yb_logs, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-clean_cores, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-clean_cores, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-clean_cores, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-clean_cores, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-clean_cores, \
   /bin/systemctl start yb-collect_metrics, \
   /bin/systemctl stop yb-collect_metrics, \
   /bin/systemctl restart yb-collect_metrics, \
   /bin/systemctl enable yb-collect_metrics, \
   /bin/systemctl disable yb-collect_metrics, \
   /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

2. Ensure that you have root access and add the following service and timer files to the `/etc/systemd/system` directory (set their ownerships to the `yugabyte` user and 0644 permissions):<br><br>

   `yb-master.service`

   ```sh

### Use node agents

To automate some of the steps outlined in [Provision nodes manually](#provision-nodes-manually), YugabyteDB Anywhere provides a node agent that you can run on each node meeting the following requirements:

- The node has already been set up with the `yugabyte` user group and home.
- The bi-directional communication between the node and YugabyteDB Anywhere has been established (that is, the IP address can reach the host and vice versa).

#### Installation

You can install a node agent as follows:

1. Download the installer from YugabyteDB Anywhere using the API token of the Super Admin, as follows:

   ```sh
   curl https://<yugabytedb_anywhere_address>/api/v1/node_agents/download --header 'X-AUTH-YW-API-TOKEN: <api_token>' > installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh
   ```

3. Verify that the installer file contains the script.

3. Run the following command to download the node agent's `.tgz` file which installs and starts the interactive configuration:

   ```sh
   ./installer.sh -t install -u https://<yugabytedb_anywhere_address> -at <api_token>
   ```

   For example, if you execute `./installer.sh  -t install -u http://100.98.0.42:9000 -at 301fc382-cf06-4a1b-b5ef-0c8c45273aef`, expect the following output:

   ```output

           • Completed Node Agent Configuration
           • Node Agent Registration Successful
   You can install a systemd service on linux machines by running node-agent-installer.sh -t install-service (Requires sudo access).
   ```

4. Run the following command to enable the node agent as a systemd service, which is required for self-upgrade and other functions:

   ```sh
   sudo node-agent-installer.sh -t install-service
   ```

When the installation has been completed, the configurations are saved in the `config.yml` file located in the `node-agent/config/` directory. You should refrain from manually changing values in this file.

#### Registration

To enable secured communication, the node agent is automatically registered during its installation so the YugabyteDB Anywhere is aware of its existence. You can also register and unregister the node agent manually during configuration.

The following is the node agent registration command:

```sh
node-agent node register --api-token <api_token>
```

If you need to overwrite any previously configured values, you can use the following parameters within the registration command:

- `--node_ip` represents the node IP address.
- `--url` represents the YugabyteDB Anywhere address.

For secured communication, YugabyteDB Anywhere generates a key pair (private, public, and server certificate) that is sent to the node agent as part of its registration process.

<!--

You can obtain a list of existing node agents using the following API:

```http
GET /api/v1/customers/<customer_id>/node_agents
```

To unregister a node agent, use the following API:

```http
DELETE /api/v1/customers/<customer_id>/node_agents/<node_agent_id>
```

-->

To unregister a node agent, use the following command:

```sh
node-agent node unregister
```

#### Operations

Even though the node agent installation, configuration, and registration are sufficient, the following supplementary commands are also supported:

- `node-agent node unregister` is used for unregistersing the node and node agent from YugabyteDB Anywhere. This can be done to restart the registration process.
- `node-agent node register` is used for registering a node and node agent to YugabyteDB Anywhere if they were unregistered manually. Registering an already registered node agent fails as YugabyteDB Anywhere keeps a record of the node agent with this IP.
- `node-agent service start` and `node-agent service stop` are used for starting or stopping the node agent as a gRPC server.
- `node-agent node preflight-check` is used for checking if a node is configured as a YugabyteDB Anywhere node. After the node agent and the node have been registered with YugabyteDB Anywhere, this command can be run on its own, if the result needs to be published to YugabyteDB Anywhere. For more information, see [Preflight check](#preflight-check).

#### Preflight check

Once the node agent is installed, configured, and connected to YugabyteDB Anywhere, you can perform a series of preflight checks without sudo privileges by using the following command:

```sh
node-agent node preflight-check
```

The result of the check is forwarded to YugabyteDB Anywhere for validation. The validated information is posted in a tabular form on the terminal. If there is a failure against a required check, you can apply a fix and then rerun the preflight check.

Expect an output similar to the following:

![Result](/images/yp/node-agent-preflight-check.png)

If the preflight check is successful, you would be able to add the node to the provider (if required) by executing the following:

```sh
node-agent node preflight-check --add_node
```

## Remove YugabyteDB components from the server

As described in [Eliminate an unresponsive node](../../../manage-deployments/remove-nodes/), when a node enters an undesirable state, you can delete such node, with YugabyteDB Anywhere clearing up all the remaining artifacts except the `prometheus` and `yugabyte` user.

You can manually remove Yugabyte components from existing server images. Before attempting this, you have to determine whether or not YugabyteDB Anywhere is operational. If it is, you either need to delete the universe or delete the nodes from the universe.

To completely eliminate all traces of YugabyteDB Anywhere and configuration, you should consider reinstalling the operating system image (or rolling back to a previous image, if available).

### Delete database server nodes

You can remove YugabyteDB components and configuration from the database server nodes as follows:

- Login to the server node as the `yugabyte` user.

- Navigate to the `/home/yugabyte/bin` directory that contains a number of scripts including `yb-server-ctl.sh`. The arguments set in this script allow you to perform various functions on the YugabyteDB processes running on the node.

- Execute the following command:

  ```shell
  ./bin/yb-server-ctl.sh clean-instance
  ```

  This removes all YugabyteDB code and settings from the node, removing it from the Universe.

  If you cannot find the `bin` directory, it means YugabyteDB Anywhere already cleared it during a successful deletion of the universe.

You should also erase the data from the volume mounted under the `/data` subdirectory, unless this volume is to be permanently erased by the underlying storage subsystem when the volume is deleted.

To erase this data, execute the following commands from the `centos` user on the node (or any user with access to sudo):

```sh
sudo umount /data
```

```sh
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M
```

The preceding commands assume the data volume is attached to the server as `/dev/sdb`.

If there is a requirement to remove the `yugabyte` user, execute the following command:

```sh
sudo userdel -r yugabyte
```

If there is a requirement to remove the `prometheus` user, execute the following command:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /opt/prometheus
```

You may now choose to reverse the system settings that you configured in [Provision nodes manually](#provision-nodes-manually).

### Delete YugabyteDB Anywhere from the server

To remove YugabyteDB Anywhere and Replicated components from the host server, execute the following commands as the `root` user (or prepend `sudo` to each command) :

```sh
systemctl stop replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
service replicated stop
service replicated-ui stop
service replicated-operator stop
docker stop replicated-premkit
docker stop replicated-statsd
```

```sh
docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator \ replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor \ retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres
```

```sh
docker images | grep "quay.io/replicated" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs sudo docker rmi -f
```

```sh
docker images | grep "registry.replicated.com/library/retraced" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs sudo docker rmi -f
```

```sh
yum remove -y replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator
```

```sh
rm -rf /var/lib/replicated* /etc/replicated* /etc/init/replicated* \ /etc/default/replicated* /etc/systemd/system/replicated* \ /etc/sysconfig/replicated* \ /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/replicated* \ /run/replicated*
```

```sh
rpm -qa | grep -i docker
yum remove docker-ce
rpm -qa | grep -i docker
yum remove docker-ce-cli
```
