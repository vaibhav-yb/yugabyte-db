<br>You can configure OpenShift for YugabyteDB universes using YugabyteDB Anywhere. If no cloud providers are configured via YugabyteDB Anywhere, the main **Dashboard** page requests to configure at least one provider.

To create a YugabyteDB universe using the deployed YugabyteDB Anywhere, you start by creating the required role-based access control (RBAC) and adding the provider in the YugabyteDB Anywhere.

## Create RBAC and kubeconfig

kubeconfig is used by YugabyteDB Anywhere to create universes in the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster.

To create a service account in the yb-platform project, execute the following command:

```shell
oc apply \
  -n yb-platform \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/yugabyte-platform-universe-management-sa.yaml
```

Expect the following output:

```output
serviceaccount/yugabyte-platform-universe-management created
```

The next step is to grant access to this service account using Roles and RoleBindings, thus allowing it to manage the YugabyteDB universe's resources for you. If you are creating clusters across multiple namespaces, you need to create Roles and RoleBindings with a cluster-admin role in each namespace where you intend to create and deploy the universe. For more information, see [RBAC resources](https://github.com/yugabyte/charts/tree/master/rbac#c-platform-namespacedyaml).

To create the required RBAC objects, execute the following command:

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/charts/master/rbac/platform-namespaced.yaml \
 | sed "s/namespace: <SA_NAMESPACE>/namespace: yb-platform/g" \
 | oc apply -n yb-platform -f -
```

Expect the following output:

```output
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/yugabyte-helm-operations created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/yugabyte-management created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/yugabyte-helm-operations created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/yugabyte-management created
```

The next step is to create a kubeconfig for this service account. You download a helper script for generating a kubeconfig file by executing the following command:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YugaByte/charts/master/stable/yugabyte/generate_kubeconfig.py
```

To generate the kubeconfig file, execute the following:

```shell
python generate_kubeconfig.py \
 --service_account yugabyte-platform-universe-management \
 --namespace yb-platform
```

Expect the following output:

```output
Generated the kubeconfig file: /tmp/yugabyte-platform-universe-management.conf
```

## Create a provider in YugabyteDB Anywhere

Since YugabyteDB Anywhere manages YugabyteDB universes, YugabyteDB Anywhere needs details about the cloud providers. In your case, the provider is your own OCP cluster.

You can create a provider as follows:

- Open YugabyteDB Anywhere UI and click **Configure a Provider** to open the **Cloud Provider Configuration** page shown in the following illustration.
- Select **Red Hat OpenShift** and complete the fields, as follows:
  - In the **Type** filed, select **OpenShift**.
  - In the **Name** field, enter ocp-test.
  - Use the **Kube Config** field to select the file that you created in the preceding step.
  - In the **Service Account** field, enter yugabyte-platform-universe-management.
  - In the **Image Registry** field, if you are performing Operator-based installation, use  `registry.connect.redhat.com/yugabytedb/yugabyte`, and if you are performing Helm-based installation, use  `quay.io/yugabyte/yugabyte-ubi`
  - Optionally, use the **Pull Secret File** field to upload the pull secret you received from Yugabyte Support. <br><br>
![OpenShift Provider Config](/images/ee/openshift-cloud-provider-setup.png)

- Click **Add Region** and complete the **Add new region** dialog shown in the following illustration by first selecting the region you found previously (US East), and then entering the following information:
  - In the **Zone** field, enter the exact zone label (us-east4-a).
  - In the **Namespace** field, enter yb-platform.<br><br>

  ![Add Region](/images/ee/openshift-add-region.png)

- Click **Add Region**.
- Click **Save**.

You should see the newly-added provider under **Red Hat OpenShift configs**.

## Create a universe using the provider

You can create a universe using the provider as follows:

- Use YugabyteDB Anywhere UI to navigate to **Universes**, and then click **Create Universe**.

- Complete the **Create Universe** page shown in the following illustration by entering the following information:

  - In the **Name** field, enter universe-1.
  - In the **Provider** field, enter ocp-test.
  - In the **Regions** field, enter US East.
  - In the **Instance Type** field, enter xsmall (2 cores, 4GB RAM).<br>

  ![Create Universe](/images/ee/openshift-create-uni.png)

- Click **Create**.

The following illustration shows the universe creation progress:

![Universes](/images/ee/openshift-universes.png)

If you click universe-1 and then navigate to **Tasks**, you should see a page similar to the one shown in the following illustration:

![Task Progress](/images/ee/openshift-uni-task-progress.png)

Upon successful creation of the universe, the **Overview** tab of universe-1 should look similar to the following:

![Universe 1](/images/ee/openshift-universe1.png)

## Troubleshoot the universe creation

If the universe creation remains in Pending state for more than 2-3 minutes, open the OCP web console, navigate to **Workloads > Pods** and check if any of the pods are in pending state, as shown in the following illustration:

![Pods](/images/ee/openshift-pods.png)

Alternatively, you can execute the following command to check status of the pods:

```shell
oc get pods -n yb-platform -l chart=yugabyte
```

Expect an output similar to the following:

```output
# output
NAME          READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE
yb-master-0   2/2   Running  0     5m58s
yb-master-1   2/2   Running  0     5m58s
yb-master-2   0/2   Pending  0     5m58s
yb-tserver-0  2/2   Running  0     5m58s
yb-tserver-1  2/2   Running  0     5m58s
yb-tserver-2  2/2   Running  0     5m58s
```

If any of the pods are in pending state, perform the following:

- Login with an admin account and navigate to **Compute > Machine Sets**.
- Open the Machine Set corresponding to your zone label (us-east4-a).
- Click **Desired Count** and increase the count by 1 or 2, as shown in the following illustration.
- Click **Save**.

![Edit Machine Count](/images/ee/openshift-open-macine.png)

Alternatively, you can scale the Machine Sets by executing the following command as admin user:

```shell
oc scale machineset ocp-dev4-l5ffp-worker-a --replicas=2 -n openshift-machine-api
```

Expect the following output:

```output
# output
machineset.machine.openshift.io/ocp-dev4-l5ffp-worker-a scaled
```

As soon as the new machine is added, the pending pods become ready.
