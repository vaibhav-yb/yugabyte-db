## Supported projects

The following project is recommended for implementing C applications using the YugabyteDB YSQL API.

| Project | Example apps |
| :------ | :----------- |
| libpq C Driver | [Hello World](ysql/) |

For fully-runnable code snippets and explanations of common operations, see the **example apps**. Before running the example apps, make sure you have installed the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

To develop C applications for YugabyteDB, you need the following:

- **Machine and Software requirements**
  - a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) architecture machine.
  - gcc 4.1.2 or later, clang 3.4 or later installed.

- **YugabyteDB cluster**
  - Create a free cluster on [YugabyteDB Managed](https://www.yugabyte.com/cloud/). Refer to [Use a cloud cluster](../../quick-start-yugabytedb-managed/). Note that YugabyteDB Managed requires SSL.
  - Alternatively, set up a standalone YugabyteDB cluster by following the steps in [Install YugabyteDB](../../quick-start/).

## Next step

- [Connect an app](ysql/)
