[DocDB](../../../architecture/docdb/), YugabyteDB's underlying distributed document store, uses a heavily customized version of RocksDB for node-local persistence. It has been engineered ground up to deliver high performance at a massive scale. Several features have been built into DocDB to support this design goal, including the following:

- Scan-resistant global block cache
- Bloom/index data splitting
- Global memstore limit
- Separate compaction queues to reduce read amplification
- Smart load balancing across disks

These features enable YugabyteDB to handle massive datasets with ease. The following scenario loads 1 billion rows into a 3-node cluster.

## 1 billion rows

This experiment uses the [YCSB benchmark](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki) with the standard JDBC binding to load 1 billion rows. The expected dataset at the end of the data load is 1TB on each node (or a 3TB total data set size in each cluster).

| Cluster configuration |                        |
| --------------------: | :--------------------- |
|          Region | AWS us-west-2          |
|         Release | v2.1.5                 |
|             API | YSQL                   |
|           Nodes | 3                      |
|   Instance type | c5.4xlarge             |
|         Storage | 2 x 5TB SSDs (gp2 EBS) |
|        Sharding | Range and Hash         |
| Isolation level | Snapshot               |

## Results at a glance

1B row data load completed successfully for YSQL (using a range-sharded table) in about 26 hours. The following graphs show the throughput and average latency for the range-sharded load phase of the YCSB benchmark during the load phase.

The total dataset was 3.2TB across the two nodes. Each node had just over 1TB of data.
