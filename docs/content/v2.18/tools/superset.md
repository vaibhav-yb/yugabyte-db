[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is an open-source data exploration and visualization tool that helps you query data stored in YugabyteDB and visualize it using basic line charts to highly detailed geospatial charts.

You can use Superset to quickly explore and visualize data stored in databases and data warehouses. You can explore data without writing complex SQL queries, create rich reports and custom dashboards to visualize this data, and get insights quickly.

## Before you begin

Your YugabyteDB cluster should be up and running. Refer to [YugabyteDB prerequisites](../#yugabytedb-prerequisites).

You also need to load a relevant database in your YugabyteDB for exploration and visualization. For a local installation, you can load the Northwind sample database with the `./bin/yugabyted demo connect` command from your shell, or you can follow the [instructions](../../sample-data/northwind/).

## Install Superset

You can install Superset using [Docker Compose](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose) (recommended) or from scratch using [Python (pip3)](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-from-scratch).

Launch Superset in your browser at `http://<hostname-or-IP-address>:8088`. If you've installed on your local computer, navigate to `localhost:8088` or `127.0.0.1:8088`. Superset comes with a standard PostgreSQL driver that also connects to YugabyteDB. You can also manually install the [psycopg2 driver](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) to connect to YugabyteDB.

## Connect Apache Superset to YugabyteDB

To connect Apache Superset to YugabyteDB:

1. Navigate to Data > Databases > + Databases, and choose **PostgreSQL** from the **Connect a database** menu.

    ![Connect Database](/images/develop/tools/superset/connect-database.png)

1. Enter your YugabyteDB tablet server's hostname or IP address with standard credentials and click **Finish**.

    {{< note title="Note" >}}
As of Docker version 18.03, the `host.docker.internal` hostname connects to your Docker host from inside a Docker container.
    {{< /note >}}

1. Verify that you can access the available databases and schemas under "Data". Navigate to Data > Datasets, and click "+Datasets".

    The dropdown list should show the databases and schemas available to explore and visualize.

You've successfully created a connection to your YugabyteDB database, and you can now start exploring and visualizing your databases using Apache Superset.

## What's next

Refer to the Apache [Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data#exploring-data-in-superset) to learn more about Superset's data exploration capabilities.
