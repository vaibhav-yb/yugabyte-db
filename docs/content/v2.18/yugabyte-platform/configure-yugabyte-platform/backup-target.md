You can configure a variety of backup targets for your YugabyteDB universe data.

1. Navigate to **Universes**, select your universe, and then select **Nodes**.

2. Click **Connect**.

3. Take note of the services and endpoints information displayed in the **Connect** dialog, as shown in the following illustration:

4. While connected using `ssh`, create a directory `/backup` and then change the owner to `yugabyte`, as follows:

    sudo mkdir /backup; sudo chown yugabyte /backup

If there is more than one node, you should consider using a network file system mounted on each server.
