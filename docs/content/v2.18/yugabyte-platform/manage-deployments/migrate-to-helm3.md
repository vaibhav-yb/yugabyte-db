Starting with YugabyteDB version 2.1.8, Helm 2 is not supported. You would need to migrate your existing YugabyteDB universes and YugabyteDB Anywhere from Helm 2 to Helm 3.

## Migrate existing YugabyteDB Anywhere and YugabyteDB from Helm 2 to Helm 3

You can perform migration as follows:

1. Check the chart name using the following command:

   ```sh
   helm2 ls
   ```

   Expect the following output:

   ```output
   NAME   	REVISION	UPDATED                 STATUS  	CHART         	APP VERSION	NAMESPACE
   yw-test	1       	Tue May 12 22:21:16 2020	DEPLOYED	yugaware-2.2.0 2.2.0.0-76 	yw-test
   ```

2. Execute the following command to migrate the chart to Helm 3 using the `2to3` plugin:

   ```sh
   helm 2to3 convert yw-test
   ```

   For more information, see [Migrating Helm v2 to v3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/).

   Expect the following output:

   ```output
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 Release "yw-test" will be converted from Helm v2 to Helm v3.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 [Helm 3] Release "yw-test" will be created.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 [Helm 3] ReleaseVersion "yw-test.v1" will be created.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 [Helm 3] ReleaseVersion "yw-test.v1" created.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 [Helm 3] Release "yw-test" created.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 Release "yw-test" was converted successfully from Helm v2 to Helm v3.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 Note: The v2 release information still remains and should be removed to avoid conflicts with the migrated v3 release.
   2020/05/12 22:25:49 v2 release information should only be removed using `helm 2to3` cleanup and when all releases have been migrated over.
   ```

3. Verify that the chart has been migrated by running the following command:

   ```sh
   helm ls -n yw-test
   ```

   Expect the following output:

   ```output
   NAME   	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                               	STATUS  	CHART         	APP VERSION
   yw-test	yw-test  	1       	2020-06-16 16:51:16.44463488 +0000 UTC	deployed	yugaware-2.2.0	2.2.0.0-b80
   ```

## Upgrade YugabyteDB Anywhere and YugabyteDB using Helm 3

Helm charts versions 2.1.4 and earlier had the `clusterIP` field in the `services.yaml` file. Since the Helm 3 binary does not support leaving the `clusterIP` field empty (see [github issue 6378](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6378)), you need to manually specify value for this field. The following command allows you to obtain the `clusterIP` of the service:

```sh
kubectl get svc -n yw-test
```

Expect the following output:

```output
NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                       AGE
yw-test-yugaware-ui   LoadBalancer   10.103.85.235   10.103.85.235   80:30265/TCP,9090:30661/TCP   18m
```

In addition, because the `Release.Service` for Helm 3 is `Helm`, whereas Helm 2 had this as `Tiller`, any deployments performed using Helm 2 result in the `heritage` field set to `Tiller`.  To explicitly set the heritage value to `Tiller`, you can set the `helm2Legacy` variable to  `true`. You can set these fields, along with the other necessary changes, by running the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade yw-test yugaware --set helm2Legacy=true,yugaware.service.clusterIP="10.103.85.235" -n yw-test
```

Expect the following output:

```output
Release "yw-test" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: yw-test
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue May 12 22:43:49 2020
NAMESPACE: yw-test
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
```

If the chart was not migrated from Helm 2, omit the `helm2Legacy` field.

For YugabyteDB, create an overrides file, as follows:

```properties
serviceEndpoints:
  - name: "yb-master-ui"
    type: LoadBalancer
    app: "yb-master"
    ports:
      ui: "7000"
    clusterIP: "<clusterIP of yb-master-ui>"

  - name: "yb-tserver-service"
    type: LoadBalancer
    app: "yb-tserver"
    ports:
      yql-port: "9042"
      yedis-port: "6379"
      ysql-port: "5433"
    clusterIP: "<clusterIP of yb-tserver-service>"

# If the original deployment was done using helm2
helm2Legacy: true

# Any other fields that need to be modified/updated
```

When done, execute the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade yb-test yugabyte/ -f ~/Desktop/test.yaml -n yb-test
```

You should see a message similar to the following:

```output
Release "yb-test" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: yb-test
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May 13 00:00:01 2020
NAMESPACE: yb-test
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 3
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Get YugabyteDB Pods by running this command:
  kubectl --namespace yb-test get pods
2. Get list of YugabyteDB services that are running:
  kubectl --namespace yb-test get services
3. Get information about the load balancer services:
  kubectl get svc --namespace yb-test
4. Connect to one of the tablet server:
  kubectl exec --namespace yb-test -it yb-tserver-0 -- bash
5. Run YSQL shell from inside of a tablet server:
  kubectl exec --namespace yb-test -it yb-tserver-0 -- ysqlsh -h yb-tserver-0.yb-tservers.yb-test
6. Cleanup YugabyteDB Pods
  For helm 2:
  helm delete yb-test --purge
  For helm 3:
  helm delete yb-test -n yb-test
  NOTE: You need to manually delete the persistent volume
  kubectl delete pvc --namespace yb-test -l app=yb-master
  kubectl delete pvc --namespace yb-test -l app=yb-tserver
```

## Migrate a YugabyteDB universe deployed using YugabyteDB Anywhere

All YugabyteDB clusters deployed on Kubernetes with YugabyteDB Anywhere prior to version 2.1.8 were deployed using Helm 2. Starting with YubabyteDB version 2.1.8, YugabyteDB Anywhere only supports Helm 3, so you need to manually migrate the older YugabyteDB deployments using the `2to3` plugin. By default, any older YugabyteDB on Kubernetes is not modifiable using YugabyteDB Anywhere unless it is ported to Helm 3.

You can perform the migration as follows:

1. Obtain all older Helm 2 release names by running the following command:

   ```sh
   helm2 ls
   ```

   Expect the following output:

   ```output
   helm2 ls
   NAME              REVISION  UPDATED                 	       STATUS  	CHART                  APP VERSION	NAMESPACE
   yb-admin-test-a	1       Tue May 12 23:08:30 2020    DEPLOYED	yugabyte-2.1.2       2.1.2.0-b10	yb-admin-test-a
   yb-admin-test-b	1       Tue May 12 23:08:30 2020    DEPLOYED	yugabyte-2.1.2       2.1.2.0-b10	yb-admin-test-b
   yb-admin-test-c	1       Tue May 12 23:08:30 2020    DEPLOYED	yugabyte-2.1.2       2.1.2.0-b10	yb-admin-test-c
   ```

2. Migrate all releases using the `2to3` plugin by running the following command:

   ```sh
   helm 2to3 convert yb-admin-test-a
   ```

   For each migration, expect to see messages similar to the following:

   ```output
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 Release "yb-admin-test-a" will be converted from Helm v2 to Helm v3.
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 [Helm 3] Release "yb-admin-test-a" will be created.
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 [Helm 3] ReleaseVersion "yb-admin-test-a.v1" will be created.
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 [Helm 3] ReleaseVersion "yb-admin-test-a.v1" created.
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 [Helm 3] Release "yb-admin-test-a" created.
   2020/05/12 23
   :20:42 Release "yb-admin-test-a" was converted successfully from Helm v2 to Helm v3.
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 Note: The v2 release information still remains and should be removed to avoid conflicts with the migrated v3 release.
   2020/05/12 23:20:42 v2 release information should only be removed using `helm 2to3` cleanup and when all releases have been migrated over.
   ```

   Execute the same command for every release, as per the following examples:

   ```sh
   helm 2to3 convert yb-admin-test-b
   ```

   ```sh
   helm 2to3 convert yb-admin-test-c
   ```

3. Verify that the migrations were successful by running the following command:

   ```sh
   helm ls -A
   ```

   Expect the following output:

   ```output
   NAME           	NAMESPACE     REVISION   UPDATED                 STATUS    CHART         	APP VERSION
   yb-admin-test-a	yb-admin-test-a	1       	2020-05-12	deployed	  yugabyte-2.1.2	2.1.2.0-b10
   yb-admin-test-b	yb-admin-test-b	1       	2020-05-12	deployed	  yugabyte-2.1.2	2.1.2.0-b10
   yb-admin-test-c	yb-admin-test-c	1       	2020-05-12	deployed	  yugabyte-2.1.2	2.1.2.0-b10
   ```

4. Make the following API call for each universe that has been migrated:

   ```sh
   curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:9000/api/v1/customers/f33e3c9b-75ab-4c30-80ad-cba85646ea39/universes/d565bf24-39d0-4a90-a9d9-a2441e48a28e/mark_helm3_compatible' \
   --header 'X-AUTH-TOKEN: 4832fe2e-13cd-4aa6-9519-a980f14aeee2' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
   --data-raw '{}'
   ```

When the migration is completed, the YugabyteDB universe operations can be performed using YugabyteDB Anywhere 2.1.8 or later release.

## Delete old YugabyteDB universes from YugabyteDB Anywhere

YugabyteDB Anywhere allows you to delete older YugabyteDB universes, but you cannot delete the Helm 2 release.

YugabyteDB Anywhere can also delete the namespaces and associated resources.
