/**
 * This test mimics the scenario in #12767 -
 *
 * Before this commit's fix, the following scenario leads to a situation where 2 single statement
 * read committed transactions block each other -
 *
 *    CREATE TABLE test (id int primary key, v timestamp with time zone NOT NULL);
 *    CREATE INDEX idx ON test USING btree (v);
 *
 * 1. 2 read committed isolation transactions are started in separate sessions with begin;
 * 2. Both sessions get the request from client to execute a INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE query on a
 *    row in the main table.
 *
 *    INSERT INTO test AS x (id, v) VALUES (1, statement_timestamp())
 *    ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT test_pkey
 *    DO UPDATE SET v = statement_timestamp() WHERE x.id = excluded.id
 *
 * 3. Backends of both sessions first read the main table to check if the key already exists. Since
 *    it does, both backends then try to perform the ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE by issuing three rpcs
 *    simultaneously to tserver processes -
 *
 *      i) a PGSQL_UPDATE to the main table to update the v time
 *      ii) a PGSQL_DELETE to the secondary index to remove the entry with existing v value
 *      iii) a PGSQL_UPSERT to the secondary index to insert a new index entry with new v value
 *
 * 4. Rpc [a] of session 1 reaches the main table first and performs the write.
 *    Rpc [b] (and/or [c]) of session 2 reaches the index table first and performs the write there.
 *
 * 5. So, session 1 has successfully written a provisional entry to the main table and session 2 has
 *    successfully written provisional entries to the index table.
 *
 * 6. Now, the other rpcs in both session will fail due to a conflict i.e., rpc [b] and [c] of
 *    session 1 and rpc [a] of session 2 will fail.
 *
 * 7. Both sessions, after facing the conflict, will retry the statement by rolling back to the
 *    internal savepoint registered before the statement's execution (as is done by our read
 *    committed implementation). Rolling back will effectively mark the provisional data written by
 *    earlier rpcs in the statement as invalid so that the backends can retry their statement and no
 *    other transactions should be able to see those invalid provisional entries.
 *
 * 8. However, even after rolling back savepoints, other transactions consider the rolled back
 *    provisional entries for conflict resolution and hence still face conflicts. This is because
 *    the list of aborted sub txns isn't available to the txn participants during conflict
 *    detection.
 *
 * 9. This leads to both sessions retrying and facing false conflicts till statement timeout is hit.
