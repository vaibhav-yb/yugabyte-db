# instance scraping for evaluation metrics on the Yugabyte Platform
# instance. Defaults to 15s, override if you wish for Prometheus
# to scrape for evaluation metrics at a faster or slower rate.

# scrapeTimeout: The time threshold for inactivity after which the
# Prometheus instance will stop scraping for database metrics on the
# Yugabyte Platform instance. Defaults to 10s, override if you wish
# for the inactivity threshold to be longer or shorter.

# Prometheus instance. Defaults to 9090, override if you have opened
# up a different port that you wish to use for running Prometheus.

# maxConcurrency: The maximum number of concurrent queries
# that can be executed by the running Prometheus instance as
# it scrapes for metrics. Defaults to 20, override if you wish
# for the number of concurrent queries executable by Prometheus
# to be higher or lower.

# Prometheus query can load into memory. Defaults to 5000000,
# override if you wish for the maximum number of samples loadable
# by a single Prometheus query to be higher or lower.

# Prometheus service will be declared inactive. Defaults to 30s,
# override if you wish for the inactivity threshold to be longer or
# shorter.
